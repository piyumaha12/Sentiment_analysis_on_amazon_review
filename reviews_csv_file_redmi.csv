1,"  Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.

2,"  Very bad experience from Amazon. Very bad camera quality of the phone. I want to return the phone, but amazon is not taking back the phone. I don't want to purchase any product from amazon further. Leaving amazon app permanently
"
3,"  Best buy at this price! The display quality is amazing and I do not have any complaint with the camera too. There is no other phone available at this price which comes with 4GB ram. You should go ahead with this.

"
5,"  This phone is not value for moneyIts a downgraded phone of earlier phone launched in india.The camera is worst i ever seen in any redmi phone.Battery is ok.The display quality is very bad not hd. Watching videos on YouTube feels like watching 3gp videos.Dot notch display is ok in lookwise but not good in quality.Sometimes 4gb ram feels like 2gb.I am very disappointed by the camera quality of this phone.12 megapixel feels like 2MP camera.Recently i am using redmi note 5 pro. And this phone is just downgraded phone by redmi .you cannot imagine low light photography in this phone.The back plastic body feels like a cheap phone.If you really need a phone there are many options in the market.If you are taking phone for the first and a beginner you can go for redmi 9 prime.

12,"   Barely two odd weeks into my purchase, my phone faced a software glitch. The phone refused to boot. It was stuck at opening ""Redmi"" stage. Even when I pressed on OFF button, the phone switched on by itself, refusing to reboot beyond the first step. Eventually it got hot. I dropped it by mistake when I picked up the hot phone and it landed on my wooden floor. It split into two and caught fire. My floor got damaged. Thankfully it did not explode. No one was injured. I want the company to contact me and give me an explanation why it caught fire.

"
14,"  Overall its good and satisfied for the price.Pros:1. Good Battery.2. Best budget phone for 8999 with 4GB RAM and 64GB Internal Memory.The only drawback i felt is Camera.If you are looking for a better camera I would suggest to pick some other model.

"
21,"  Worst product ever as the camera quality is very poort rear as well as front. Amazon was not ready to take the return as they have a new policy now which is replacement policy so they will get you a replacement but won't take it back. Bought that in sale as had heard from friends that redmi phones are good but it ain't. Will suggest not to buy at all from Amazon as it's better to go and buy from the store atleast they take 500rs and will exchange the product. Speaker is poor you can not hear properly on speaker at all. Product is not worth in this price range as one can get better options by payin 1000-2000 bucks extra.
"
22,"  Good product. Value for money phone. Everything is average. Display is good. Battery life is also good. I bought it for a employee of mine. Overall a good phone. 4/64 combo is hard to  find in this price range. Exceeded my expectations.
"
23,"  It is a just ok kind of phone. Camera is very pathetic. I did not expect this type of camera in this phone. Even my old redmi 4a mobile is better in camera than this. Apart from camera, I could see there is some lag in the screen while moving to different pages though it has 4GB RAM. Better choose some other phone than this. It has no notification light and has a micro USB charging port. No night mode in camera.Update after using it for 20 days: the phone gets lagging all the time no matter what ever the app you use. It is completely waste of money. Do not buy this mobile.

"
25,"  My suggestion for everyone who is thinking to buy redmi 9, please don't buy.Redmi is a very trust brand but not redmi 9.I purchased this phone 3weeks ago, first it was in good condition, after 3 week it started to hang every morning, after 4 days the phone completely shutdown.I don't know what to do, before getting one month this happened.It's getting really hurt to use this phone.
"
26,"  Redmi9Too many disadvantagesCamera quality is worst:both front and rear.Processor is very slow.Body is plastic and which is uselessDisplay quality is very badMicro usb charger: this wonder, since all model new phones are coming with c-port, but this phone with old model micro usb port.Video calling is issue.Heating issue during charge aswell as during the call,You can't video call and many more issue.And you can't return the phone in Amazon.Totally this phone is gutterchap quality.

30,"  Xiaomi has provided a magnificent smartphone in low budget section with increadible feature and great visual asthetics.Pros:-1. 4gb DDR4 RAM faster then SD 6xx series2. 64GB storage3. Under 9000 INR4. 5000 mAh battery ( however the chipset consume more battery as compared to SD with 4000mAh battery will perform the same)5. Fast charging support (Definitely buy a fast charger for great experience)6. MiUI 12 is simply clean and loaded with features. Seamlessly switch from provios mi phoneCons:-1. Battery sucking chipset Helio G35, not optimize for gaming.2. Lack of notifications light(small but deadly features, you will miss it quite often)3. 264ppi display for 720p resolution looks crupmy at this huge size.4. Poor quality made in india accesories.5. Building quality is poor. As well as camera are very dissatisfied.6. Useless camera bump for 2 poor camera only just for marketing showing 3 circles.7. Loaded with bloatware and adware. Unauthorised data transfer to China.If possible go for Motorola E7 around the same price and you will have great experience with Snapdragon and clean android experience.

"
37,"  Cons :- Orange Back different from that shown in product pictures. Not attractive.- No battery charging indicator light.Once the mobile goes in sleep mode, you cannot figure if it is charging or not.- Defective Sound System : volume is generally low. No Bass At All. Sound Volume goes up and down on its own while playing songs/video.- Extremely Short (half meter) charging cable- Micro-USB B-type port- Outdated handset. Not worth the money.- No RETURN Option despite receiving defective piece- No Option to schedule technician visit before replacement window closes (all slots permanently full)Stuck with a defective handset.No scope of Return & purchasing another model.This feels like fraud.Disappointed with Amazon for the first time.
"
38,"  Phone is only for Calling, Whats App and Youtube.I gifted this phone to my mother, so as per her usage i felt its okay.Worst part is camera.... I even had Redmi Note 4.... I seriously felt Note 4  camera is much better that redmi 9.I got this phone in 7500/-
"
39,"  If you ignore this review, you ll end up regretting. Camera quality of this phone is worse than you'd have ever had. If you click a selfie you'll look an old person. No color, no texture. You can say that it's a budget phone and all that. That's true but even a simple one megapixel camera has 100 times better camera. Not exaggerating.Battery also a bit weak. Don't buy
"
40,"  I received the producton 18 th October 2021 . I was very happy with this., But suddenly on 4th November the colour disappeared look's like negative. I wrote Amazon team for the difficult & return back . Till today no response coming from Amazon team. Although I am a prime member & also items purchased more than 1200 or more. Lastly Amazon chitted me at least no single reply since 4th November 2021. How can we people trust? Thanks to Amazon team.
"
41,"  I would like to take a a few mins to write a review if this phone and Amazon service to alert everyone. Please do not but this phone if you would like to have some peace.Worst camera clarity and even more worse phone condition.Phone is heating up when charging.On top Amazon service is worse than ever to resolve this with a new phone Samsung.Disgusting customer service with in professional mannerism of agent by Amazon.
"
42,"  ====== waste of money ========1. Camera quality is very poor even 5K range phone camera is better than this.2. No full features of MIUI 12- > Clock icon is not real-time like in other Mi phones. > No one hand mode which is part of MIUI 12 so u cant operate this phone with a single hand.3. Display is also very poor means pixelated and no true colors.4. FM is not wireless works only with wired Headphone
"
43,"  This is a very good product with low price. Thanks Amazon and Redmi Mobile for this product.Excellent looks and colour and awesome features.I love this product too much thanks Amazon again.
"
44,"  For a price this low along with exchange offer is a winner. No one likes to keep the old phone and buy a new one. If they dont the mobile phones will keep piling at home. I bought this for mywife and she is pretty pleased with the buy.This is indeed value for money if you keep in mind what are your needs from a phone.

46,"  Never trust redmi
"
47,"  Battery performance is not good camera quality is not good also there is no brightness in my device I don't want this mobile
"
48,"  What is main use of a phone?...obviously to receive and make calls....if you are not able hear anything properly then whats the use of a phone. Call speaker volume (internal) is toooooo less. It is so irritating. I wasted my money on this phone. Only the battery backup is good. Rest i wasted my money on this. The phone is unnecessarily too heavy. I should have spended extra 1200 rupees and bought Samsung M series phone rather than this worthless phone.
"
49,"  If there is an option I would 3.5It's been 2 days since I got the phone and here are positive and negatives with comparison to Redmi 8a Dual (my previous phone)Battery Charging: first 30-40% is very quick in charging. But to get it fully charged it takes almost an hour.Battery Life: It runs for more than 24 hours once fully charged even if you use it to watch movies and games.Negative : phone gets heated up while charging if you leave it on cushion type surfaces like bed, sofa etc. Irrespective of the surface phone gets a little bit heated up every time you charge it. And if you try answering a call or use the phone while on charge get ready for hand and ear burning sensation.This is not observered in Redmi 8a Dual. But the battery life is less competed to Redmi 9. If you are a person who uses mobile while on charge, then I won't recommend Redmi 9.Camera Quality: if you are buying this phone for Camera.. DO NOT. Redmi 8a Dual has better selfi and rear camera quality. Selfie camera is worst and rear works on in perfect lighting and when you try to zoom on objects it looses it's quality.Storage: Go for it.Volume: Good but when compared to Redmi 8a dual it's little bit low.Overall if Redmi 8a Dual is much better than Redmi 9. Except for the storage and battery life.
"
50,"  Mobile screen in good,battery backup excelent,Daily usage good,Gaming experience Laggy PUBG, Call of Duty is almost not possible to play in this game,it has 4gb RAM but still not good enough to handle gamesCamera quality is worst, not even near to expectations.Chinese's knows well how to attract Indians, Camera Megapixel, Camera filter, sound, Big screen and very common attractive looks.for normal usage like calling messaging, whatsapp and all this device is more then enough,If you are game lover or photography lover this device is not at all for you,If you just want a decent android mobile for daily usage its good
"
51,"  Nice product
"
52,"  Within a week after the phone purhase I faced a defect in navigation software which is crucial in today's time.. couldn't return as it expired 48hrs delivery time.. went to service center and they couldn't fix the phone defect in 1 week as promised.. I argued and they gave me a new phone in same model for usage meanwhile my actual phone is being repaired.. found the same defect in new phone as well.. my issue still hasn't been resolved from the Redmi company.. bad phone and service.
"
53,"  Never falling for cheap price again. I got it for 7149₹ at sale with extra 10% card discount. It was good for couple of months. Then it started showing some issues. I bought 4gb ram variant. Yet it got slower than my old phone which is 2gb ram. My old phone's camera is Front 2mp and Rear 8mp. But still my older phone gives much better image till date. My older phone's battery was 2400mah, and again Redmi 9 last only till evening, when charged in morning. Whereas my older phone lasted till Night with remaining 20-30% battery.I thought I was upgrading to a better phone, but no, I paid over 7000₹ for phone that is worse than my 5 year old phone. All the fancy features are nothing but gimmicks to attract customers. It's a cheap phone, that obviously have cheap parts in it. That will work fine for sometime but eventually devolve.
"
54,"  I used to have a Motorola Moto G5S Plus phone as a secondary phone and recently i changed this to Redmi 9. Here are the advantages and disadvantages. This is assembled in India and is a good value for money offering.Advantages1) I wanted to replace the phone with the cheaptest entry point phone with a good display.  The Redmi offer HD+ not full HD, but it is okay for my usage.2) The MIUI is extremely pleasing to the eye and gives a good user experience.3) The ease of set up of Redmi 9 was awesome. It was a dual SIM phone with Volte and 4 G SIM support on both SIM4) Also we can extend the existing 64 GB storage with upto 512 GB SD card, I have procured another 64 GB storage5) It has an FM radio thrown in as well.6) The camera is okay not highly fancy similar to the Redmi 9 Power, but this being a secondary phone I am okay with the overal performance.Disadvantages1) The charger is the only mini USB and wish this was a USB C type charge with quick charge.2) The Wifi detects only 2.4 GHz and not the latest 5GHz hence the overall connectivty speed is low.For the price point that is 2500 Rs less due to exchange and overall pay out to be around 6150 Rs, this phone is a value for money offering. At the time of buying this was the top phone in the Amazon phone range, but given a choice would have opted for Redmi 9 Power, that had a better feature.

55,"  I just bought and unboxed it.its a budget friendly Smartphone. in this box contains a Smart Phone,Sim Ejecter Pin,10 W Charger,Micro USB Cable for Charging.HD plus DisplayAnd Operating system is Xiaomi Latest user interface MI UI12 .Water Coating ,in this price range its display and sound is not bad.And better experience.Demerrits is  Not a fast charger ,IR Blaster feature is not available.It is not a big demerrits .in this price this is an amazing smartphone.I liked this Phone and recommend my friends because its a budget smartphone.Now many phones provided everything good  more than redmi 9.i repeat its a budget smartphone. That because i recommend my friends.  Anything i missed discuss to you ,sorry about that.  Thankfully  Amazon Customer  More Than Amazon Lover
"
56,"  This phone is a budget smartphone with decent performance. I am using this phone for last 3 months so I am sharing my views basis my experience. If you are bying it for regular uasge like calls, watching YouTube and whatsapp then it's good. Don't consider this phone for gaming or heavy usage as it lags then. I hav bought this phone for my son for his online classes, calls and for YouTube videos so it's working fine.
"
57,"  Third grade phone from MI Looks like 2 years old technology used in phone micro USB charging point in phone very very slow charging... Even 6k phones from mi r giving c type charging in phones.the camera quality is so pathatic that any 5/6 k cheap phone can click better image than this,really wanted to return the product n get my money back to buy another set but there is no option to get the money back.Shame on u mi using more than 2 years old tech in ur new phones.
"
58,"  I have checked it myself that the second space feature is not available in this phone. MI customer care is saying it has second space and service centre saying it does not have . I did not find any better solution other than returning it because a brand like MI is misguiding customers. The hardware is so downgraded that it cannot handle second space . So they have removed the feature from this phone which is available in each and every phone running MIUI. Worst experience ever ......
"
59,"  Pros :1: Sharp display despite only being Hd+ instead of FHD+2: Decent gaming processor , guarantees a smooth 50+ fps gameplay on many games3: fast storage , ram and is somewhat bloat free with a really good OS skin4: Really nice grippy texture5: Above average speakersCons :1: Average camera (though that's expected)2: Doesn't have full fledged fast charging so may take upto 2 hours for a full charge3: No earphones in box (but most people don't use stock earphones anyways)Verdict : Really good phone for a tight budget of 11k but if you chip in 5k more the Redmi note 10 is a good choice as wellNonetheless an all round good phone at its price range
"
60,"  First of all, product launched in September 2021 with old version of Android android 10 while android 11 was in market. They are not providing update of android 10 to 11. It is that slow, even YouTube struck.  It feels that I am running a Chinese mobile of year 2010.Don't buy it guys. Just for the sake of large customer base Redmi is in unethical business.Guys don't fall prey to Redmi's trap.
"
61,"  Don't get fooled guys by redmi 9 activ and amazon, The display as well as camera quality is disappointing. Their is very poor display with extremely poor brightness. Unless you switch it to maximum the display lacks brightness. Also the camera quality is extremely disappinting, both the front as well as back camera. Return policy is not applicable and only replacement is possible with same mobile and that too in the case of recieving only damaged product. Here also the customer will be feeling like befooled as once purchased the mobile, it can not be returned at any cost. Very much disappointed with MI as well as Amazon. No where they have mentioned clearly that the mobile can not be returned except for damage, only they are mentioning that 7 days replacement is possible making it dubious for customers. Kind of feeling cheated withAmazon as When I have resources available but still will have to bear with a lower end mobile whose performance is not at par just because it can not be replaced by Amazon. Not sure when Amazon started these cheap kind of gimmicks erasing it's brand name. No support by Amazon for this kind of performance/satisfaction issue with product. Think twice before purchasing this redmi 9 activ mobile. Only if you have budget issues then only buy this mobile. Because once bought it can not be returned. The phone is lagging in speed also. Their seems issue with power button too. Overall the quality of the mobile is compromised too much and a much better mobile can be bought at this price(6gb + 128gb) waste of money

"
63,"  I write this review after using the mobile for 14 days, first 2 weeks it's awesome 😍, after that the mobile is getting OFF automatically & after few minutes getting ON, I thought this might happen as a new handset that comes with few updates. Then after 17 days the mobile got OFF & never ON again. I visited Mi service center they said the mother board is damaged, they kept the handset & asked for 1 week minimum for recovery. This is the worst 😭experience with Amazon & Mi India.
"
64,"  am using amazon for the past 8 Years, today i have faced a really bad experience.i have received a faulty mobile, i contacted amazon to make a refund. even they agreed. still for past 5 days i haven't received any response from amazon, the faulty mobile is with me of No use.Very bad response from amazon.
"
65,"  It supports only 2.4GHz wifi. If you are looking for faster internet speed then take a note on this, that this phone won’t support 5GHz wifi connectivity.Also noticed that the while having video call through WhatsApp, the call gets disconnected after a few minutes and then never gets connected.Sometimes it auto restarts.I am regretting on decision to buy this phone for my mom. My recommendation would be pay a bit higher but go for better brands.
"
66,"  Amazing product 😊 thanks you
"
67,"  I recieved mobile on 9th August 2021, when open the box unable to power on mobile. Same day I called to support they initiated replacement. Delivery boy came to my home at same day. He tried to power on mobile, as I already said this mobile is not powering on. He started argument without IMEI varification I will not give you the replacement. My question is here if mobile is dead then how and why he was insisting. Did customer care support team have raised proper request for replacement. Carrier guy cancel my replacement. I called again to customer care I explained everything and they said once replacement cancelled. We can only refund. I accepted that preposal as well. Same thing happened here again when carrier guy came to my home same question asked for IMEI varification I need to power on mobile.boss if phone is dead then how you will varify. This things happen almost 5 time. What I observed here customer care support team is not initiating my refund properly.I am prime member on Amazon but my experience is very very bad still I am struggling for refund.

Watching videos on YouTube feels like watching 3gp videos.mobile display is ok in lookwise but not good in quality.Sometimes 4gb ram feels like 2gb.I am very disappointed by the camera quality of this phone.12 megapixel feels like 2MP camera. The back plastic body feels like a cheap phone.If you really need a phone there are many options in the market.If you are taking phone for the first and a beginner you can go for redmi 9 prime

76,"  I went to service center for inspection the kept the phone for 2 day's for digonosis  at last chasing them out they told me that main bord of your phone got damaged due to water went inside the phone via finger print. But i haven't used phone in wet hand at all neither it went into water. Pathetic service experience ever faced in service center. Then i went for another option of open market where they took 2000/-  and my phone started working as usual where as service center manager refused to repair and told me the expense will come around 8000/- to replace display as well main bord of the phone. That to we will not take any assurance it will work. This is the condition of service. Very disappointed.

77,"  Value for money product. The #Redmi9 is best mobile at this rate which comes 2.3ghz clock speed and 4GB ram. Very smooth and I liked the battery capacity very much. I can play pubg on it for continue 5 hours after full. So happy that I buyed this mobile. I love the #MI brand very much.#Redmi9_iz_lub

78,"  Product is good but protection (back cover) not provided and not available in market for this model.Pl. Provide suitable simple back case for minium protection
"
79,"  It is not C-type chager that's the first thing to fooling the customer and second one is every mi phone has  ir blaster but it doesn't having, I bought redmi8 it has both features and as it is old model and I bought it for @of ₹8000 Only but nNow it has 8799 by loosing the these features as I am get fool for the product I bought and Amazon also having the hand in it. It has to be take responsible for it
"
80,"  Best Budget phone.Dear Customers please remember that the Price is always directly propotional to the quality.This low price model lacks Type C Charging port. There is no Type C port. Its the old pin.Sound quality is really worst.My sincere advice to spend 1000 more and go for Mi 9 Pro.
"
81,"  Purchased this phone on 07/11/2021. Find below my reviews.Display: It is goodDesign: Ok (I feel it could be designed much better than current design)Finger print: Not facing any issuesBattery: FineCamera: Very poor. Most of the time the photo is blurred, especially photos taken in AI mode.Most of the people mentioned the camera is not good. I believe a 13mp camera is good for me but I never expected the camera quality to be this much worse.If you want to purchase a phone specifically for photography then I strongly recommend please go with some other phones.Reason behind why I chose Redmi is, Last Diwali I purchased a Samsung Galaxy 31 for 16,000 during the great Indian festival. But within a year there was an issue with the motherboard. So I don't want to put more pennies on my phone.
"
82,"  Good phone in this price category.Pros -# screen size is good and can be use with 1 hand also.# look of the phone is good in compare to others phone of this category.# phone i haven't used much but 5000 mah battery would be good.Cons :-I have not found more but on the back side 2 camera are there and one camera is just dummy print.Suggestion :Better to go with 128 GB. Mine is 64GB only.
"
83,"  I don't like the phone because it is not working in manner..It is self rebooting continually in every 10Seconds.Please mark this issue and start rectifying in further device production...Because your service centres are not being operated in service manner..Actually they just manipulate the all customer instead of resolving the issues..#Mi service centre , aggarwal plaza, mangalam palace, M2K sector-3 , Rohini , Delhi .

84,"  1: Purchased for Father who is knew to the smartphone world operation and features and it served his purpose the very best in this range of INR 10K.2: Also in the mobile industry every thing changes so dynamically that sky rocket configurations and prices have no limits hence sticked to this fix budget of INR 10K and features to an extent to conclude the purchase.3: Orange Color is quiet charming and pleasant to opt as well.

85,"  4GB RAM 64GB StorageColour: blackDONT BUY THIS MOBILE .Don’t buy this product .Image quality is below average comparing with the specification. Useless camera.And there is NO RETURN POLICY and replacing with same mobile is big headache .DON’T buy this mobile

86,"  Fast Fingerprint reader, large and clear screen, huge battery, overall well built. I choose this for my girlfriend, she doesn't play heavy games, for that matter she doesn't play any games on smartphons, so the Helio G35 with 4gb ram and 64gb storage is more then enough for her Facebook insta, and the 6.57inch HD display is also great for her nonstop Netflix and other media consumptions. She actually needed a phone with big screen and finger print security. Plus good battery life and no lags. So redmi 9 was a great gift for her. I myself use Realme x2pro because I'm a heavy user so that super amoled fhd+ 90hz display is a sureshot nessesity for me and a phone with the Snapdragon 855+ processer was what I was looking for under 35k.  First I thought to buy her some similar phone but than I thought why? She don't need that much powerful phone, so I gave her exactly what she needed. Huge screen, huge battery, good camera decent processer, 4gb ram. For her multitasking and 64gb storage for all her photos songs and videos and yea it has option for expanding the memory too which my phone doesn't have so I have to stick to the 128gb only.
"
87,"  Someone should give Nobel Prize for creating such a third class phone. If you put your phone idle for a few minutes SIM card is not getting detected. (Screenshots attached). So I became not reachable over phone. Now with a restart it again can detect both the SIM and joyfully if you give a call to someone from either of the dual SIMs on the other side over the phone none will hear any sound 🙄 now thinking if I had bought any feature phone atleast I can connect to people over a call. Now when bought , Amazon showed 7 days replacement but now waiting for some technician visit to confirm that this model has a manufacturing problem. So a strong No No for this product. Don't be trapped over the lesser price rather go for some pro Series of redmi if needed.
"
88,"  I am so addicted to Amazon now that I don't even remember half my orders. They just come and I take them. It's that simple. This  product had a exchange option where i had to return my older phone. No problems. The entire process took 10 mins. The executive came took my phone check a few things and game me the new phone and left. Amazing !!
"
89,"  My primary phone screen shattered and due to lockdown I'm unable to fix it.Ordered redmi 9 and Amazon delivered in  1day. A miracle! At these times.Great phone for the price, really happy with performance. Never heats up. Battery last 2 days with heavy use.Camera very very poor quality.So if buying for camera consider higher models.Highly impressed for the price.Go for it.
"
90,"  If you pay peanuts you get monkeys - that's quite true for the Redmi 9. With good specs on paper available at the then low price of Rs 9000 I made a greed-fueled decision to go for this. After 3 months I find the glass has scratched all too easily (as opposed to my Lenovo smartphone), the MIUI OS is buggy as hell and the gyroscope just does not work so moving the phone around does not change the orientation in GPS maps (or games). Overall a pathetic device.
"
91,"  I have purchased this and gifted. This is not a good phone where the quality and the performance is poor.Camera is poor.Charging slot is not type-C & not quick charge too, will have to wait approx 3 hours to complete the charge.Screen rotation is poor where it is taking 1-2 complete seconds to rotate the screen.Overall the quality and the performance of the phone is poor. I would recommend to not go with this phone.Atleast am allowed to write this comments in Amazon whereas if I would have purchased in mi.com, they'll block my comments and will not post if I give a rating less-than 4.
"
92,"  Its a great phone but don't buy Acko insurance with it as theyvare fraud.I bought the insurance with the phone, I got a message from Acko to register and I did. I saw the insurance being activated on my number and the device but the very next day without any reason they cancelled it themselves . Then it was a fight between them and Amazon. Amazon suggest to buy the insurance again which I did and again Acko denied it as it was not bought with the phone. I just feel its a fraud going on, they generate interest with insurance with phone and later cheat like this. DONT BUT ACKO insurance

93,"  Dear teams, This is to inform you that I have purchased Redmi 9 (Sky Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)| 5000 mAh| 2.3GHz Mediatek Helio G35 Octa core  as per the our friend request, but this phone camera is very very poor quality front and back also, and main important when we can attend the meeting on Zoom or webx after 5 minutes showing on screen  CPU is too high uses please close the APP.. our main motive purchase this phone for online class for Daughter.. but over all very very poor performance. we will definitely returns the product but after purchase i was sick, so then 10 day over other wise we will never keep this phone. now we are helpless for returns the product..ThanksShashikant

94,"  Redmi 9 (4GB RAM + 64GB Storage) Delivered by Amazon on 4th Aug, first two week worked properly.But after that started facing below 2 issues.1. This mobile is unable to detect any SIM, tried with factory reset too.2. Also noticed that volume bar popping up on screen automatically and unable to increase the Mobile volume by using button, this issue got disappeared for some time after rebooting the mobile but that reboot button is also not functioning sometime, need to press that button multiple time to get the reboot / power off option screen on mobile.
"
95,"  Inspite being a nice phone in budget, this phone has issues:1. Doesn't support split screen2. Doesn't support 5ghz wireless frequency3. You can't use this phone as a remote control for devices that are not wifi enabled (IR devices)4. If you use this phone as a mobile hotspot, you can't view devices connected to your hotspot5. You can't get one-handed modeThese are features that you will find in Mi phones even in a lower range.
"
96,"  Writing the review after 3 months of usage.1. Look and fell of the product is good.2. Fingerprint sensor is bit laggy.  Sometimes it didn't read the fingerprints.3. Performance is ok, Can't say it's too slow. But if you want fast performance than go for something else.4. Camera quality is ok. Not too good but not to bad.5. Battery life is good.I bought it for my mom and it serve the purpose.If you want to use all the capabilities of smart phone please look for something else.
"
97,"  Good look phone with 5000mh battery, but camera quality too disappointing. No IR blaster, No C type port. I had purchased redmi 9 (4/64) by exchanging Redmiy3 (3/32) . But actulalky redmi y3 is far better then redmi9. I desire to return it. If any one want to purchase redmi phone then go for redmi 9 prime and avoid to buy redmi9
"
98,"  Bought in october 2020. One day delivery from amazon, great as always. Using the device since then, so here is the detailed review of redmi 9.- Built quality is good overall. Feels a midrange smartphone and a bit bulky in hand, due to plastic back. But other than that, phone is built decent.- Processor stack (Helio G35) is mediocre, to get the job done. Provides adequate performance, nothing too fancy there.- Having a battery of 5000 mAh, it lasts roughly around whole day while performing day to day activities like streaming, browsing and downloading. Never tested games on it. So, performance might differ in that case. While charging device heats up significantly, while taking from 0% it took 5 hours to make it 100% as its bundled with 10W slow charger.- The IPS HD+ display is doing well, I haven't got any issues regarding color accuracy, saturation or viewing angles as of now.- Speakers are decent, not that great. Call quality and cellular reception is good, on par with the other alternatives.- All Mi phones has the same issues in software part as this one also having MIUI, packed with a lot of bloatware and stuff. Security patches are updated regularly, but the overall update cycles are indefinite and after an update some features just stops working randomly. After OTA update, phone dropped signal, kept restarting, keyboard is not appeared when focused on an inputbox, etc etc. Overall an laggy android experience.- Camera is really disappointing. Not good at all, the daylight images are bad, HDR is not working properly. Images taken in night are even worse.These are the things I have found during 5 months of usage. Thanks
"
99,"  Let's start with the pros:A really good battery. Easily runs for an entire day in higher than average use. Lightweight, Sleek, Has smooth fingerprint sensor, loud and has a really good processor if you're a game lover. The photos despite twin cam setup are good and only get grainy in low light. Use pro-mode if you want the best output.Cons:No type C charge or Fast Charge Support. Could have been better had there been tri cam setup like Poco C3 (it lacks FingerPrint Sensor though). Non Stock Android is a turn off as phones like Moto G10 Power and many other have either Stock Android or lesser bloatwares while MIUI is notorious with its UI.Summary: Go for it if you're MIUI user as it will feel very homely. Also, if you are a game lover an want something under 10K, this is one of the options you should go for. Don't opt for it if you're hardcore into photography.7.5/10

100,"  Reviewing on behalf of my customer-I have purchased it for selling in my shop name happymind.I sold to one of my customer and after a month of use he gcame to my shop and given following feedback-He said i have given him a very good product that meets his demands like he is able to work his daily routine work on phone , and the battery back is long lasting.Sound quality is also very good.Design is also very good.Camera quality is very good in this price range phones.It worth buying product.

"
103,"  I bought this for my nani quality is great even i tried some gsmes like wcc3 abd wcc2 it handels perfectly but at low setting, according to price mobile is awesome battery backup in 6 - 8 days if only use for calling and if you are multitasker then easily last for 1-1.5 day on heavy to moderate use, now coming to camera the camera is not ss great but i got this for 8000 it worth every penny i spend you can't accept a flagship level camera at this price, if you are a camera lover just don't buy but if you want big storage big battery abd classy looks and a trusted brand just go for it you will not regret at your decision. Handels multitasking easily but not a gaming processor, you can use 10 apps wp, fb, YouTube and all without any lag issue. Phone doesn't heat that's good. Great quality mobile at affordable price thanku MI. And  Amazon
"
104,"  Bad mobilemy suggestion for everyone who is thinking to buy redmi 9, please don't buy.Redmi is a very trust brand but not redmi 9.I purchased this phone 3weeks ago, first it was in good condition, after 3 weeks it started to hang every morning, after 4 days the phone completely shutdown.I don't know what to do, before getting one month this happened.It's getting really hurt to use this phone.
"
105,"  Phone hangs so many times, switch off while using. watching video on YouTube, incoming call doesn't show but ringtone plays, camera quality average, phone performance is below average, battery performance is fine, Amazon services is poor, sends technician, he hard reset the phone then he checks it for 4 or 5 minutes and say it is ok, what if it's performance if you have to hard reset it 2 time during 7 days, because after hard reset every phone works perfectly for some times while technician checks it for 5 to 10 minutes. Very bad experience with Amazon services and xiaomi product this time.
"
106,"  Specification good enoughBought for attending online classes and it is very smooth. Have tried streaming videos, MS office files and I have not seen any lags.Not much of a gamer so haven't utilized 100% of HW.Charging time is about 3 hours and lasts more than a day.Camera quality average.1 major concern for me is the display when the phone is operated outdoor. The brightness level is so low we can barely see anything under the sun light

"
110,"  Just in  one sentence..Those who are interested in buying a good camara phone, don't go for it.. it disappoints you ..It may attract you only with respect to it's 4GB RAM and 64GB memory and the 4 camaras is just to draw your attention at this price range of around 9000 but I strongly recommend you to spend a little more amount on some other models by going through their genuine reviews..👍👍
"
111,"  The phone is of 6.53 inches and it's so big. The camera quality is also nice.When I ordered the phone I was checking people's review some was saying it's bad, some was saying it's camera is not good and some were saying it's awesome and much etc but then I decided to order it when the phone reached to me I checked it, like always amazon gives you the best. Overall I wanna say about the phone is you should buy it, it's so good❤️🙏👍 #loveit

112,"  It is the best phone at 8999
"
113,"  The product is good to use, but giving 1 star because I can't use it to call anymore the speakers are too low to hear other persons voice..Not recommended..Bought 4 pieces for the staff all of them have similar issues.Maybe I should have to stick to a good brand.

115,"  Purchased this around may end and got it delivered by June 1st week 2021 and I am writing this review on 2nd September 2021. So basically I have used this for 3 months. I am not someone who uses phone for gaming or prolong use. I use it just for calls, message,mails, WhatsApp and payment. That's it. Not even fb, insta, Netflix, prime, nothing. So I have basic uses. Still this phone started showing problems in less than 3 months. Problems that the phone showed in less than 3 months:1) It has started slowing down2) the charger wire has loosened up and I had to use a spare one which I had3) the phone is so heavy that when you hold your phone in your hand for long calls like 30 mins call without using earphone, or if you chat for some 15-20 mins, your wrist will hurt, I got carpal tunnel syndrome by using this just for 3 months and planning to get a minor surgery soon. It's weight is more than one plus series phones.4) the worst camera quality I have ever seen.One can think to buy this for urgent use or for very short term use. I had to buy this when my samsung phone got into a drain and I really needed one asap and during May month all shops were closed for 2nd wave of covid. This phone will definitely show some issue withing few months even if u r a moderate user, not using much social media and not palying any games.
"
116,"  Writing Review after 1 month use:Over all mobile is quite good in this price range but camera quality is very poor.I would suggest don't buy this phone, go with Redmi 9 Note.Poor camera quality.Bettery life is very good.MIUI 12 (Android 10) is very good. Smooth performance, don't hang with normal usage.Screen quality is good.Finger sensor is very quick.Amazon's 7 day replacement policy is very poor. If your phone has really any defact then only it will get replaced with same model. You can't return & buy another better model.
"
117,"  Read the Complete Review for better understanding.I bought this phone for my father (moderate level usage). Majority of his consumption is Whatsapp, Online banking, UPI, and Emails (No Games or Videos/Movies at all). He has been using this phone for 3 months now.Pros:1. Good Display (8/10)2. Battery is fine (6/10) Bcoz the phone is not used for gaming or watching videos, the battery lasts for 2 days easily3. Fingerprint Sensor works fine (6/10) Hit and Miss, Sometimes works and Sometimes doesn't.4. Audio is great (8/10)Cons:1. Bad Camera (3/10) Both, The Rear and the Selfie cameras are very low res. Other than just basic photo taking, You can't do anything.2. 4gb Ram is a lie- After you start using the device you won't believe it has 4gb ram, the phone is very slow. If you'll open more than 3 apps, the phone will start to hang and i am not talking gaming, just simple appsFinal Verdict- In the Description, it may look like you are getting good specs at this price but it is not the same in hand. Forget long term usage, You will be fed up of this after max. 1 year.Advice: Put in some extra thousands and buy a better phone

This was the reason and trust I ordered one more redmi mobile for my younger brother but I'm surprised with the camera quality. it's very bad and guys don't buy this mobile if you're looking for a good camera in the mobile. There are other mobiles available in redmi and other company which is more worthy. I'll attach some pictures so that you guys can aware of this before buying.

124,"  At this price range if you want to buy a mobile for your online class and for your children then I will recommend this product. If you want to buy this mobile for other purposes then I will recommend to don't buy it.And don't go to the youtube review . Really it too different after I buy I knew very well.So it is your choice what you di.
"
125,"  I bought it for my mother, and she is learning to use it. 4GB/64GB at this price is really good. Touch is very responsive and quick. Screen quality is little dull and sound output is low compared to other Redmi phones. Redmi needs to work on these for budget phones. Camera is average as it is not camera centered phone. Network reception and battery power is good, last for 1.5 days with normal usage. Overall good phone for beginners and elderly people to start with
"
126,"  Display better for this price but if you can spend a 1000 rupees more go for Redmi 9 Prime which has better FHD display and good processor than this.  Function is good especially for online classes and also the size of display is good for online classes. Games mild okay.  Camera is really bad in even very light conditions.  Good only in bright places and close-up shots. Overall 3.5 out of 5.
"
127,"  To start of with mobile has medicore camera with a quality of mobiles in 2010s. Even with 4gb ram it hangs a lot which will definitely frustrate you a lot. Battery backup is poor and the charger isn't type C. It takes around 4hours to charge fully.PS: I bought this phone for my dad and he only takes call and uses WhatsApp. To my surprise he himself wasn't happy with this mobile due to its poor performance and the screen which is LCD which cannot play HD videos. Colours in video isn't punchy and can make look a red colour a orange colour.I have asked Amazon and they have replaced with a new unit and the customer care representative is completely supportive. Can't blame them for the products efficiency.
"
128,"  It's been three days now. My readmi 9 phone is performing well. I like the blue shade back cover, the camera picture quality is good, much better than my previous phone. Battery lasts for a day after full charge. I watch a lot of videos on Instagram and youtube and I make a lot of calls. Battery lasts for one day with all this usage. Finger is my favourite. I can unlock the phone with a simple touch.

Everything was going fine for the first 3-4 days but all of sudden my phone get starting auto restart at the interval of less than a minutes. I am not able to use my phone from yesterday since it is auto restart as soon as I unlock it. Not satisfied with this product at all.

138,"  I like this phone.But, I have trouble with the automatic settings regarding battery saving. If the mobile screen is off, whatsapp gets offline. But I need it always online as I am using whatsapp web on my computer always irrespective of whether I use my mobile or not.If the system shows that whatsapp is using battery that simply means that it is in use. So, the basic idea should be to continue to provide what is in use rather than to stop it. After all, I bought it to use and not to waste my time in going through all the available settings in the system.

"
141,"  Very good features for a budget phone. Acceptable performance and for its huge battery surprisingly is light weight. Full day usage sees only 50% of battery left. Screen resolution is so smooth. Highly recommended.
"
142,"  Excellent phone for price below 9k. Exchanged my old phone so got it for even lower price. Bought it for mom and perfect for her use.Pros:1. Large screen2. Good sound3. Blue colour looks good4. Does daily tasks like calling, youtube, gpay with ease5. Good battery6. Overall good experience7. Speaker is loud tooCons:1. Very average camera. Daylight condition is fine. In night, camera quality can suffer.Overall still good phone and worth buying. If camera is specifically needed then try something else.
"
143,"  i like the camera it is good ,the screen is also good but i feel that the bezels are somewhat big but the overall form factor is good but the only thing that i am not sure with is the processor as it is a mediatek processor but it works fine it would have been nice if they have given fast charging option  but for the price it is well rounded so if you are looking for a good phone under 10k go for it

146,"   Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps

147,"  Genuine product.Loved this phone... actually bought for my mom on her birthday she loved it.. 💙Made in India and has no ban apps pre-installed that's impressive.Overall worth buying. Totally budget phone with good configuration.Ordered on last night got the delivery early morning 8am that was so fast very impressive.
"
148,"  Very bad experience with this phone1)Camera below avg2)Charger Not working within 2months of purchase of mobile. and also there customer service center not replace tha charger they just make any excuse to not provide you warranty replacement of products3) when you playing game and getting calls most of the time hang or screen get blackout4) Most of the time Dual sim network not work properly. When someone calling you thay said outoff network or switch off. while phone is still on5) i really feel bad to choose this mobile. I generally don't write review but after this kinds of experience i just thought to write a review to help someone to not choose this mobile
"
149,"  You CANT connect to 5Ghz wifi! Their website info is misleading. It's not dual band! I am now stuck with 2 mobiles with hardly any speed to access net while I have a blazing Airtel Internet connection at home!The whole phone is sluggish.Battery is very good!Camera also is kool.But overall a worst choice for extensive users of wifi! That's it.
"
150,"  Battery life is all fine ...If you aren't a heavy gamer u can rely on ur fully charged phone for the whole day longFingerprint reader is very appropriate , untill you get your fingers wetCamera quality is quite average ...But you get the slow motion mode for videos which is quite finePerformance is slightly above average ...You can play 7 to 8 hours of gameBut the heating problem exists...And I personally hate it ...I don't know why they aren't working on it ..You could burn your body hairs with the heated back surface of the phone .Display is okay ...You won't complainOver-all at this budget range this is probably just best phone ...Go for it without a thought if your budget is tight ...You won't get something better
"
151,"  After 15days of use, it starts hung up, I have used Redmi earlier also but this is worst, I have bought it on exchange, is this new handset or renewed set, I don't know but after 15days of use and only 23gb using out of 128gb, it hang up. Very slow response of screen. My old mobile Redmi 4 was  far better then this which I have exchanged. Redmi india what shall I do. 03/11/21- i have updated miui, now seems ok,  no hanging issue
"
152,"  The overall performance of the phone is very good but the camera is not very much when compared to other phones pixel rate is I don't know it's not good also. the alarm option alarm  it is not at all making any sound. When you set an alarm it is very hard to hear the alarm sound
"
153,"  I got this phone in deal in Amazon shopping festival hence was able to encash the opportunity to buy it. What could be better at budget range with 6 gb of memory and 64 gb of storage space. Camera is good but not for people who love to click selfies and more. Best deal for my uncle and he was happy with phone. What could be best to make some one smile. Thank you Amazon
"
154,"  A simple smartphone. Don't get too much hyped for the features being provided in this budget.Its a normal smartphone with regular qualities.Pros-1. Large Screen size2. Loud Speaker3. Battery LifeCons-1. Lags from the first unpacking in setting up the phone.2. Not a user-friendly interface. A first user will face a lot of difficulties while using.3. Camera doesn't justifies the quality and mps.4. Fingerprint scanner can be stubborn.
"
155,"  For simple usage of calls, watsap and video calls, the phone is very good but not made for extensive use like playing heavy gamesThe camera quality is not so much good but it's satisfactory.All other features are good. Overall it's a nice phone
"
156,"  Does not feel like a phone released in sept 2021. Features and phone is exactly like redmi phones 2 years ago....nothing special except better more ram and storage in the price range.No earphones provided and the FM radio still requires headphone as antenna.Battery us 5000mA but it still last 24hrs only. 2years ago 3000mA also lasted 24hrs so bigger battery no big deal.
"
157,"  specifications are ok but poor cameraboth cameras are not so gooddisplay brightness is low in dat lightperformance is ok
"
158,"  Mobile looks bit okay, not too good. But yes redmi will overtake other brands in this price range, that's why redmi rockzzzz. But camera is very poor, if you are a selfie & photo crazy person I won't recommend this. For a normal person who needs battery & other benefits this is better mobile.Pros : Stylish look  User friendly  Battery stand upCons : Poor Camera  Bit bulky in hand  Bit overweight.Overall in 10 K this mobile I rate 6/10. Much better than other mobiles. kinda okay👌.
"
159,"  Worst product.When we are in conference call getting lot of disturbance. When i filed a complaint.one of the home technician called me and telling me that with out checking the mobile and with out coming to the home. He made a call directly and asking what is the problem and i have explained it. He told ok sir if customer care calls to you tell i have came to the home, with out visiting my house he is telling like that. And he told iam keeping order for new mobile in place of old. But when I contacted CS team they hva etold me there no new order placed on your number. And i was shocked. And technician wrote report as all is good. Now what i have to do?
"
160,"  Awsome smartphone. The display is good, facelock,fingerprint, are good. Has lots of features in one and functions very fast and well. Another thing camera is also good but not so much as of Samsung. Most important in this budget you are getting 4GB Ram and 64GB storage that is the best. Lots of important pre installed apps/wallpapers. Good display. Battery not found so good. You can buy it freely if you are not a heavy phone addictor. Will have good result.
"
161,"  I buy this mobile on but there is hitting chargger an mobile both .so I call Amazon customer service there is one executive he told me some software check an update but I don't try because of I buy new phone then why should I try ............that's time executive speak his supiror an told me pls pack this mobile I arrange new pack pic return.Thanks to Amazon return my mobile an give me another mobile within 3 working day's I m very happy my mobile I recieved an check all is working properly.Once again thank executive I forgot that's name but thanks a lots ........I m sure next time any product buy I m going on Amazon ..........
"
162,"  Too much pre installed apps that never can be uninstalled,so taking many spaces,,,its front and back camera low quality, charging cable is not C type,its the pin type old usb cable, overall I am giving 3* as per my experience,also notable that colour of mobile what i ordered 80 % different
"
163,"  It's a cool phone with an awesome look with good battery life and an average camera. Thought it would be heavy and difficult to handle... But once I held it in my hand it was very lightweight and slim.. overall great phone to buy in such an amazing price!
"
164,"  I am writing this review after a month use.1. Camera is difficult to operate as in case of point & shoot the image captured is not clear. Even low priced old phones score better on this count.2. While searching names, most of the time the names do not show in drop down menu/method, which is irritating.3.The Mi music player do not operate as no songs feature  in it.Even on searching the playlist show as empty. Till now i am unable to play it.4.Battery life is just OK5.Overall I am unsatisfied from this phone, I had a big reputation about Redmi phones ,but this Redmi 9 is, failure. Redmi 8 is better, which also I am using, although it is older verdion.
"
165,"  I feel AMAZON shopping a very happy and experience about my buy new MI redmi mobile at low weight,speed processor low price,more futures have. Totally satisfied a mobile use. Battery back up status is well and expected.my family is lucky at this mobile buying.once thanks to AMAZON great job.
"
166,"  The phone is working fine but not having IR device to operate as TV control as I am doing for earlier amazon redmi3 & Y or Redmi 8 note phones. Else performance wise phone is good.The body of the phone is definitely not like note phones but sounds good.
"
167,"  Very Good phone at these price range.  In 64 Gb Its already system used 12 Gb.  Camera quality poor, Its saying 13 Mega pixel,  I don't think so, it maybe 5 Mega pixel.  Once I cancel my prime membership,  delivery was delay.  Thanks Amazon. Now redmi coming made in india sticker
"
168,"  I bought this phone for my daughter and she's happy to get it. She got online classes and she's happy to get a nice phone. She's not able to control her excitement as she didn't expect the good phone, she also play games on it and it's as per the needs.
"
169,"  In, terms of speed ,memory and ease of use, it's good. Battery and fingerprint reading are excellent. But when, it comes to the speaker output with, certain, well known apps such as zoom, it's not good. Also the recorded voice does not have a reasonably good volume when played back.
"
170,"  Phone is good in segment, i love the display its very clear and detailing.Battery back up is super, goor performance, built quality finishing etc are excellent, on the part of camera iam very disappointed cz redmi need to improve the clarity of camera considering the other company in this segment. Just ok thats all about camera. Otherwise its a nice pack and value for money
"

"
172,"  Bought this phone for my parents. They don't play games nor spend hours on social media, the battery life for the elders is awesome. For their usage (mostly watching youtube, whatsapp, zoom calls, MS teams, and other common applications) this has been a good gadget. With 126GB internal memory, this phone is not going to indicate memory low even if they receive 100s of social media forwards and voice notes. The mobile came with unwanted apps, which I deleted while setting up. Very happy with the clarity of text and the font size. Apps don't appear to be cluttered and notifications are displayed clearly. Overall happy with this mobile.
"
173,"  I use dis cell for calling, txtin, 8ball pool. Cell is awesome. Smooth ui. Wat amazon really amazed me was tat the manufacturing date was 10/2020.i ordered 16 of Oct. Phone is perfect. I Don game n take pics. Dis is a grt budget mob. Ty amazon. (for the  grt xchange offer) RAGHAV HAPPY 😁🎉
"
174,"  They don't provide screen guard, cover and IR sensorCamera quality is also not upto markAlso don't provide type C data cable for charging and data transferRest all good till now
"
175,"  If you need a phone under 10K with decent features then this is the phone ..
"
176,"  I am going to write review about my redmi 9 phone, i bought this phone 2nd time. I truly satisfied with its price range  for like this featurestic phone.Battery is working whole day for my need.Phone 's body is rough and tough.Camera is actually averaged not super.Fingerprint is works smoothly.And last, screen of the phone is working as like as other redmi phones.Phone never hang.It's speed is also better.
"
177,"  Why do these mobile companies launch different model with same names? To lure someone into buying inferior product with superior name? The Redmi 9 available in India has far less features than the Redmi 9 available outside. Its a different model itself.I paid ₹1000 more for this. No Compass, poor display and camera and battery life is far less than my previous Moto phone with 5000 mAh battery. I should have enquired more. The compass was the main reason I went for this model. Now all festival offers are gone.
"
178,"  I have been using Redmi phones for 4 years now. Used multiple phones & found this one with worst camera. Had used Redmi 4 before, it was just 8 MP camera but takes very beautiful photos. But this one is very disappointed for the price. Other than camera, everything else is goodIf you are not interested in Camera, you can go for it
"
179,"  OsmAmazing experienceAll in oneMind blowing phoneSpecial thanks to mr manu jainCo-founder miLot of thanks
"
180,"  Bought this phone for my father.... He has minimal usage and he doesn't need more multi tasking. He is content with big screen, triple camera and sound quality.So people who need performance shouldn't consider this phone... Better go for Snapdragon processor.The camera quality is average... What else you can get at this price range.. The sound quality is amazing... It's loud and clear.The fingerprint reader is aso amazing....it's fast and responsive.The battery life is also good considering average usage...Works for one and half day.
"
181,"  if u want best features search another model instead if buy Redmi 9Activ.Here is my rating after 1month uses.👉Ram Good👉Storage Good👉Camera Average👉FingerPrint Good👉Disply Touch Average👉Battery Backup Good
"
182,"  I always used to feel that spending more than 10k on a mobile is waste for people who uses his mobile  for a small period of time, iam the person who uses his phone hardly for 2 hrs a day, I used it for 4 days in a single charge I felt very great.
"
183,"  Whatsup call and connectivity  Camera.Third class Phone  Connectivity very poor . Whatsup call not possible . Earlier Vivo Y 10 was incredible . Wasted money  Feeling sorry . This was a gift to my mother to have whatsup calls .After seeing so much Hype from Redmi I was carried away on this . I would have gone to Vivo . Redmi should improve the connectivity to get good response
"
184,"  I have purchased couple of phones of Redmi, but This is the worst phone I have ever got, unfortunately didn't look it's functionality earlier otherwise I would have returned it on same day.Don't pay attention to paid review or the people who never used the good phones.If possible please do get some better phone instead of this.
"
185,"  Ok is goodI give a presentation to my wifeI know very well for the six months for 8 month mobile will work 100% good after it will know what is a problem coming this is my experience in my life this is the seventh mobile I buy in my lifetimeAnyway thanks for the teamworkI hope all teamwork people with good health without coronavirus god bless everyone
"
186,"  Beware.. Don't just look at the cost.This mobile does not have gyroscope sensor. So you cannot view VR (virtual reality) Google VR app is not compatinle with this mobile.Also there is no infrared so you cannot use the MI remote to operate TV, SET TOPBOX Or Your AC.
"
187,"  I was worried by seeing the negative reviews. But then I purchased it and now I am happy. It's a good mobile. Overall it's performance is upto the level as per the price. Some people are expecting it to run as high priced phones having lots of more features. It's overall good.
"
188,"  1 month review. Easy to use phone even for elderly after shifting from Samsung smartphone. Camera is sharper than Redmi 6 and focuses better too. Battery lasts for 3+ days with minimal internet usage. Sound quality is good.
"
189,"  Worst phone.....camera quality is like VGA camera both front and rear camera. Voice during call is not audible even speakers are not good.Really total waste of money. I would never recommend this phone to anyone. If anyone is about to buy this phone then  please do some research from your side before purchasing this phone because it's performace specially in camera quality next call sound is far far below average.Please do not 🚫 buy this phone.A big NO for this phone.
"
190,"  Worst👎 mobile phone📱 of Xaiomi I had ever seen. First bad experience with Xaiomi. Just on second day of unboxing phone getting hang. Battery🔋 back up is worst even after 5000 mAh, back up is not enough for one day. I think this is duplicate mobile phone of Xaiomi. I want to replace with Redmi 9 prime.
"
191,"  I usually buy phones directly from the Xiomi store.Never ever had any UI or app not loading issue with my older devices with just 3GB of RAM.Have recently purchased this phone on Amazon. It doesn't feel like using 4GB for the same usage.  When the UI will be stuck you don't know. Having worst experience. Not sure of the root cause.
"
192,"  Am writing this review after 6days of purchase, really this phone is not at all worth the money we give, especially the camera clarity it's just like a basic keypayd mobile like camera, I had redmi 8a with me which was 100% better than this mobile which I exchanged for this mobile. The battery life is also not so good.. Overall just a smartphone for those who never take photos and less usage... Pls think before buying.
"
193,"  At first, my dad was happy with the phone with all the basic smartphone features until the Network issues started.The Wifi Calling doesn't work even though it's working from my other Samsung phone over same Wifi and Mobile Operator.When Wifi-calling was switched off, calls went through but Without ANY Rings. This is clearly a product fault.Not even 2 days, I have put Screen Protector, will you send me New screen protector too with phone replacement?
"
194,"  Not from hardcore gaming - but play you can play pubg/bgmi only if u r fan, all thing as mentioned,dual camera but quality is not that much goodaverage gaming performanceoverall buy this if your for daily use and movies multimedia becz of big screenlook is awesome and for light gaming 1-2 hours
"
195,"  Hi order this phone via amazon by exchange offer,  I tried the same with flipkart but  they rejected the phone  which was working fine.  Thanks amazon for accepting the old phone.A big thumbs-up to amazon
"
196,"  It is just okay type of phone, camera and sound quality is not good, any old 5k phone will give you better picture. Bettery life is good.
"
197,"  It is very bad please don't buy it. When I oder this I got a used product . It have no modern functions.Split screen is also removed. camera is very Bad . I suggest you if your budget is 8,000 to 9,000 you should buy Redmi 8a dual with 8mp camera which is better than this.And if budget is 9,999 you should buy Redmi 9 prime. Overall it's depends on you.
"
198,"  Redmi 9 is a phone which is quite justified seeing it's price. It has an amazing battery. The storage is more than enough at this price but somehow the camera quality lacks in places that somehow makes you wonder or regret of only I could have gone for Redmi 9 Prime. Anyways. It's a great phone to use. It comes with a 10W charger which takes time but for me it's a plus point cause for my previous phones, I didn't get a charger.
"
199,"  Best budget mobile under 9000/-Better to go with Redmi 9 Prime
"
200,"  Camera quality not great compared to Oppo.... I don't recommend buying this phone. It gets heated up too soon and sometimes screen gets frozen or keeps flickering...
"
201,"  Obviously, Good Battery is a plus. If someone markets this phone for Fast finger reader is Nonsense.  Can't you afford a few milliseconds extra.The manufacturer has taken granted your phone for posting Ads as they wish at your cost.  This is ridiculous.If you are looking for your own phone, this is not a good choice.
"
202,"  The fingerprint sensor, and the battery power are good features of this phone. Picture quality with the different cameras are just okay. The phone is working smoothly even with additional installation of other apps.
"
203,"  Phone has auto restart problem it's been 20 days and in 1 hour it almost restart 38 times and it appears after ur return replacement date over..... Disappontted plus the brightness is very very low.... Quality is not as expected
"
204,"  This phone delivered on 4th November 2020 with in 1 month (1st December) it got complained. From the beginning itself charging was too slow and phone getting heat also,but I didn't mind that only because this was common for redmi phones . But On Dec 4th when it had 70 above percentage charge suddenly it got switched off, then I tried to switch on but didn't  works so, I tried charge the phone then that's not worked. At-last I charged by other phone charger and got charged. After the use of 10 minute I noticed that charge was getting reduced.
"
205,"  Mobile is okay but Camera is a crap, no headset and no back cover with this mobile also this is not a fast charging mobileRest all is fine runs smoothly.
"
206,"  I wish I had seen the reviews before purchasing this phone. The front camera is so horrible that I'm wondering if their so called specification of ai enabled selfie camera is even true. Would not recommend this phone to anyone. So disappointed
"
207,"  Works good. Smooth. But if you have all the social media apps then it may lag a bit. Dont try heavy games. Battery is concerning when all these social apps are in the phone. Camera is ok. Finger print reader is fast
"
208,"  It's been 4 months I have been using this phone... Camera quality bad n the phone is getting hanged many times... After long time a got phone which is not worth it.. The touch pad is not good as well... Plz don't go fr it... Even if u have any emergency try some other one not this one
"
209,"  Not good phone. Some time found error in all apps and data connection lost automatically after reset defult work properly..WIFI CONNECTIVITY IS SO POOR.I have also vivo y81 phone above 3 year old  and purchase a redmi 9 but when i connect my vivo ph with my TV work properly.and when i connect my phone REDMI 9 WITH MY TV some time cant connect and if connect succesfully after 1 min movie not show fluently..DONT PURCHASE REDMI 9.I FEEL BETTER WITH MY OLD VIVO Y81 BETTER THEN REDMI 9.
"
210,"  By buying this product i am very happy ist battery life is more than 20hour and it never warm i play 2 hour continued game but it is not warm it is more batter than other products in this range
"
211,"  I have upgraded from redmi 5 to this, in design compared to redmi 5 this is not that good. Bettery is good, big dispaly but not bright as redmi 5, performance is ok. Cameras are ok for the price range. Good for online classes for my kid, but not a worthy upgrade to redmi 5.
"
212,"  after buy redmi 9 I was not satisfied with quality and functioning of product I complain to replacement, company replaced it, this handset also defective and due to facing dengue in my family members so I was not used the handset and go to hospital for treatment. after which date was closed for return and refund status this product performance is very bad we have seen two product of same model both are not run properly and its models are defective if possible please help to us to change / refund .
"
213,"  Worst quality phone. Fall from 3ft hight only and screen broken. I think no Garilla glass here. Heating issue on average use. When I use screen recorder to record something from browser selecting system sound option , it's can't record it.
"
214,"  It's ok. but not upto the mark.camera is not good, battery life is good.speed is ok
"
215,"  I purchased this phone in Oct 2020 and after using 9 months very smoothly, it accidentally fell and screen damaged completely. We had taken Acko General Insurance so we contacted them and they picked device from home, replaced with new screen and delivered to home !!! This mobile and it's insurance both are truly value for money.
"
216,"  First of all I must thank Amazon for delivering the phone in less than 24 hours. The exchange was hassle free.I have been using Redmi phones since 5 years.  The features present in Redmi 9 are not available at this low price. If you want a all rounder with a limited budget go for it.
"
217,"  Dear All,This is very unfortunate to tell you about this product and Amazon.in that they have promised an extra cash back of Rs 500/- on this product whereas when this product got delivered, there was no cashback given to us. Hence it can be concluded that whatsoever amazon says it does not do and what they do they never say. In my case the product tag line is mentioned as extra cash back of Rs. 500/- whereas the Amazon.in has failed to provide the cashback to us.
"
218,"  Bought this phone for my mom and she uses it quite a lot. She says the battery life is superb but other than that it's an okay device to use. Camera is not good, so is the UI. Has an issue of hanging/freezing frequently.
"
219,"  if your phone is slighty chipped on the corners they void entire warranty and charge you additional service charge of 118 rupees even when you have warranty just to  have a look. worst phone to buy not a common man phone anymore.. worst camera and they have removed the IR blaster
"
220,"  Phone display is big but brightness is not good.  Hence, the user is required to set higher level of brightness for display. There is a yellowish shade in display part. It is a average budget phone.
"
221,"  Got this phone for my grandparents, i was able to get a good deal on it.The phone has a nice big screen, display is average quality,definitly good for media consumption,the ui is clear, MIUI is easy to use.The camera is poor thoughbut if 10K is the budget, this is a go to phone, hands-down.Definitly a good buy!!!!
"
222,"  The photo quality is worse compared to any phone in this budget.The build quality and color are good.Not seen any performance issues.. I'm only dissatisfied with the camera.. Very bad quality of pictures

223,"  Don’t buy this product .its worst product of this range.Image quality is below average comparing with the specification.And there is NO RETURN POLICY and REPLACE with same mobile is worst thing about this product or company.😡😠Total waste of money......DON’T buy this mobile ever
"
224,"  Mobile charger getting heat after connecting 5min. I decided to replace the product and i fill all details and send it Amazon now they are saying we didn't receive any returns message from my side..... Better you go to serive center and claim there only we are help less.
"
225,"  Do not Buy 5G wifi not connecting and helpline number is not capable of helping... so its false marketing
"
226,"  The display suddenly goes away.The calls get hung.What's app call gets  disconnected and it does not reconnect again nor allowes other person to call.Given a chance we would like to return but that window is closed nowBattery life is good and camera is not working t bad.Finger print is nit tried so far.
"
227,"  I bought this for my mother in law and she expressed that it is not receiving the signal properly where as my father in law samsung at the same home same location is working all fine with same service provider.
"
228,"  OK, Phone for a regular user.* Use for a month and heating issue if play games or in charging.*Battery is not as per details, only one day use.*Gave it to mother as it was not for a regular user phone who wants To watch Heavy Videos,Surfing, Browsing, Calling. (Forget about heavy Gaming)*Camera is Ok, could be better.* Overall Good Phone for users who just want a smart phone with not heavy usage.
"
229,"  It's a bit laggy when you play games like among us or roblox on it. Else it's totally fair for the price. And the problem which I am facing the most is this phone is very heavy and it's horizontally long and vertically small. This makes it very hard to hold the phone in one hand. Also there is actually only 2 cameras whereas when you look at it from outside it d look like it has 3 cameras. Xiaomi please fix this as no one wants an unnecessary camera just for show off.
"
230,"  While transferring data from my existing Redmi,the new one shows everything recd but when opened I see a good no of apps not transferred .GMail tfd bt wd only 6/7 mails .Uber,Ola,Yahoo mail....and bank apps not moved.Now while downloading a bank's app it is just moving n moving .So slow from my old mobile ! I dnt know what to do with it .
"
231,"  Best of the best under 10 k . I bought this for my dad. he really liked it. Thanx mi
"
232,"  I thik it is the best product in this range of smartphone devices. Camera quality is good with AI, but need to improve more. battery life is sufficient for the whole day continuous use. Fingerprint sensor is working smoothly. I mostly use it's focus mode feature to spend my time in fruitful tasks and stay away from any kind of distraction. Overall it is a good product. I like it.
"
233,"  I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE EXACTLY ONE MONTH BEFORE FROM TODAY.IT IS 17TH FEB 2020 AND I BOUGHT IT ON 17JAN 2020.ON THIS DAY THE PHONE SUDDENLY STARTED GLITCHING ON IT'S OWN.THE LCD SCREEN IS NOT WORKING.THERE IS NOT ONE SINGLE SCRATCH OR DENT ON THE PHONE.I WAS WATCHING VIDEOS ON IT.I KEPT IT ON THE TABLE AND WENT TO WASH MY FACE.I CAME BACK AND SUDDENLY THE SCREEN GOT TOTALLY DISTORTED.NOT AT ALL GOOD.
"
234,"  Recently I have purchased this mobile and within 15 days mobile's problem occurred. This mobile automatically switched off and then switched on... Again I have faced same problem and now this mobile is not working...... Amazon guys straightly avoided my problem by saying about their 7 days return policy..REDMI Service Centre address which is given on Internet also faulty. I have personally visited 2 service centre but now they had shifted elsewhere......
"
235,"  Within 2 months the device showed issue by not connecting to mobile network. Tried re- booting and re-inserting sim but nothing working... It was really frustrating experience.. Primary purpose of a mobile phone has stopped working..Called Service centre and I was informed about a couple of steps including some updates and factory reset. There was some issue with the software updates, which was supposed to be automatic OTA. If an update (which the user was not aware of) stops the phone to connect to a mobile network, then it is really tough to debug, if someone is not there to help you with the required wifi or technical expertise.
"
236,"  Camera quality is very bad. Also it started to hang while using. My mother in law is using this mobile and she only watch YouTube and use it for making and receiving calls. Sad.
"
237,"  An amazing smartphone from Mi with all the basic and lovable features needed for me within the price limit of 8000. I got this phone for 7499 rupees for the 4+64 GB variant. It is among the few phones to give 4GB RAM under 7500 rupees.
"
238,"  I bought this mobile for my mom and it was a huge upgrade for her as she was using Redmi 4 earlier. Also I got Rs 2200 discount for the exchange. Overall the mobile is pretty good for daily use. She can make video calls from Whatsapp, browse facebook for a while and watch youtube videos. I have noticed little bit lag while opening the apps but it's not significant. Camera is okay for daytime photography. Overall I will give 3/5.
"
239,"  Music player automatically slow down in the middle of the song playing, please response this problem.As per this model of mobile, camera needs protection of back cover because without back cover camera not in a safe position when anybody uses this mobile and puting on table or anywhere.I don't like this you don't provide back cover for this mobile. As per current situation of covid, shops are not opened,I am not able to buy back cover of it
"
240,"  Battery is good, fingerprint sensors are average, screen size is good and works well under bright sunlight.Coming to the camera, camera is below average, I compared the camera with realme 1 phone and picture quality of redmi 9 is poor as compare to realme 1.
"
241,"  Issues are arising when YouTube videos are played. It is hanging. Charging  is too slow. Even processor is slow.Shall update after 1 month of use. Hope it survives that long.
"
242,"  Redmi 9 mobile I was bought a month ago but now phone showing hanging problem it's really shocking to me internal storage 4/64 but i always face hanging problem it's very unfortunately but it's true my opinion to new peoples think about buying this mobile please avoid it.
"
243,"  I really love this mobile gifted to my mom marriage anniversary all are best in this price segment ❤️ love this Best phone all specifications and fingerprint face unlock works fastly and sim network work perfectly loved it thankew so much Amazon great Amazon all services and delivery on time as always 🙏❤️

246,"   Fingerprint is not working,display is not working after getting the phone I was so happy but it disappointed me after 10 minutes as the screen strted blinking, touch is not working,anything gets typed automatically again everything is fine after 5-10 minutes and again it started the same. Refund should be given to a customer because how will the customer trust on you whether the replaced product will work fine or not for few days month or on the same day. I want refund of the product.
"
247,"  It's a worst mobile phone i have seen ever in my life.... It's very slow and lags frequently during any operation... If there is negetive rating facility then more than 75% people give it negetive ratings... The person who is happy with big screen without any other logic they can give this positive rating for such a third class phone at this high cost....
"
248,"  (1) Camera not good at all. (2)A tempered glass should have been included in the overall package. (3) An earphone set would have been handy.(4) Battery susceptible... Says 5000 MAh but I'm not sure.(5) Charger head gets heated up in no time.(6) Says 64gb internal whereas 12 of the 64 is already consumed by in built apps.(7) Till date can't easily find accessories online like what is there immensely available for a Redmi note or a Redmi prime.
"
249,"  It was the best decision to buy this product #redmi 9Thank to my friend and #MIIt has so many features in such a affordable price, so really looking forward to this
"
250,"  Redmi 9 was not good..  After seeing the reviews in Amazon I bought this mobile but camera quality is very poor.. It's been 15 days of using this mobile it's hanging and while speaking others in the call can't able to hear our voice.. I wonder whether this is real product or duplicate I received.. I thought to return this but we opened this package very late ..till then the exchange date is completed..It's not the worth of 9k..Think twice before buying this..
"
251,"  From the very 1st day It has a connectivity issue during audio or video call..after lodging a complain and exchange , they called and said you need to take your phone to nearest Redmi service centre. They didn't take any responsibility. Even according to order they should visit my place to check the phone. But they didn't..they just called. And I requested for exchange within 7 days of buying. Pathetic experience.. ...
"
252,"  Had purchased this for a relative, who wanted a budget phone with features that can be useful for her children attending online classes. It was pretty comfortable to use and the performance is also good. If you are looking for a budget phone, this is a good option.
"
253,"  If you are looking for good camera quality then this is definitely not the phone you are looking for.This phone is good only for long battery life and nothing else.This phone was bought for my sister who doesn't use much but still she wasn't happy with this.This is not worth buying.
"
254,"  Using K10pro-very happy and contented, purchased this one without thinking twice, charging take ages, desktop browsing is very unfriendly, do not have type C charging, over all not to happy with the product.
"
255,"  It is one of the best in helping me in making content of tik tok.It is better than Double Apple Iphone XXXS max pro
"
256,"  Please don't purchase it because it's processor is very slow, only after 15 days of using it showing as like hanging problemIt is processing like keyboard mobiles not touch phone, battery performance is avarage, if you use it single handed mode then it work normal not good, I am very disappointed with Mi, my old vivo v1 work batter then it. So be careful and with 2-3 thousands more spending, buy other brands batter mobile not it
"
257,"  Its good for parents. Not for youngster camera quality not good in back side they showing 4 camera point but its have only 2 camera 1 flash and 1 dummy design i brought to my mom so....
"
258,"  Looking good but Product quality is not good as the value. And there's no any earphone, tempered glass and back cover with it.
"
259,"  When i have received the phone and unboxed it, it was pretty good but the system inside was also good but when i started to do something like typing or any other work the touch doesn't work. When i touch any application or any thing on the screen everything happens automatically. I cant to any work in the phone. Phone has got lagged and everything is automatic in the phone. Being a new mobile everything is automatically happening.
"
260,"  Redmi mobile can't be compared with any other mobile brand.its unique.as fas as my experience of using redmi 9 is concerned it's the most efficient and not high but highest quality of product I have ever usedAlmost all brand of mobile smartphone I have used but redmi especially redmi 9 is simply excellent.i recommend all to those want to purchase a  quality budget phoneThank you
"
261,"  Review after long usage.Positive points - battery backup is good. Charging time is ok, as it 10 watt charger.Display is very good, can be visible in sunlight also. UI is lag free.Negative points - No compass, vital features like screen pinning, split screen removed by company.
"
262,"  Didn't expect such product from Mi. Very low speaker sound compare to redmi 8A which is chipper then this. Performance is also very lagy. With only whats app use without installed any games and apps no smooth operation in phone.
"
263,"  This phone is good and if you want to buy a budget smartphone then you should go for a but if you want to buy a gaming smartphone then this phone is not good because while playing games the phone is very lacking and I can't play the game properly so if you want to buy a budget smartphone then you can go for it but if you want to buy a gaming smartphones so don't go for it. And its battery life and camera quality is also good.
"
264,"  A good phone for the price, considering the fact that I researched the features and settled for this phone fornits battery back up and price range nothing to complain about. All advertised features present and working well, bought it for my mother so her requirements were a big enough screen and good battery back up which matches this phone...very happy and content with the product.
"
265,"  Quality is very bad, my opinion is to spend some more but don't buy this.Display is very dull.Touch speed is also slow.Camera very bad even i feel this is 2MP instead of 5MP.I brought through EMI, so they are not returning this product. If you are doing same trying with EMI to buy this, Please don't do that because they won't return and you will left with this phone to use which is very irritating.
"
266,"  Don't buy this.You wasted your money if you bought this.Redmi 8 is better than Redmi 9 in over all performance.Finger print reader is wrost and mic 🎤 is wrostee then wrost. None can hear you from other side without literally like barking.
"
267,"  Just an ordinary Rs. 6000 phone type.  Just quad cam lookwise is a great feature.  Otherwise no good pic quality, display also poor.  Bought this on flash sale for 10,000. Overall, average product. 😑😐
"
268,"  Product is good BUT Don't expect fingerprint reader would act as a guard to prevent unauthorized user to access it. I purchased the device for my mom and added her fingerprint expecting only she could unlock it. Much to my surprise, everytime i put in my finger on the sensor, device gets unlocked.Camera quality is okaishSound is bit slow on ohone callsBattery life is decent according to the price range.
"
269,"  Worst product i ever used,,this mobile getting hanged every time ,,already software update,,factory reset and clear cashes everything done but still no use..when ever it hangs i need to click on power button then again it will works,,same happening for last 1 months..i purchased this product before 4-5 months..i didnt expect this kind of a failure product from Mi...
"
270,"  At first the battery life was amazing, I could go the whole day without charging, now it is started to lessen faster.Good camera for the price.Touchscreen is very receptive and good.Fast processing.One flaw I found is the ultra saver mode of the phone stopped working within a month. It was so beneficial to keep the phone on during the night and now whenever I click on it the phone restarts.
"
271,"  Dont Expect too much from this phone.GOOD BATTERY LIFE- but takes a lot of time to chargeDisplay is ok- Sharpness is missingCamera is decent for outdoor shoots. Indoor it is just ok.IR blaster not availableDisplay size is huge so good for watching moviesLight weight phone.Potrait mode is good outdoors only.
"
272,"  Please  don't buy this mobile, such a worst mobile.Camera is utterflop, navigation is like china guys face only.Picture quality is worst.Phone is very slow in switching between apps.Sound quality is not good, it is like some speaker sound in olden days functions.I request you to please don't buy redmi
"
273,"  First you people show us we can replace and return item, and after delivered if product not good and we have to return or replace with another item then you will show us policy that it cannot be return and it only replace with another piece...Poor customer support and phone Redmi 9 is bad and poor camera quality....
"
274,"  Good thing about phoneAverage camera, above average battery, nice speedBad things about phoneWeight, low camera pictures quality,High price, and very important it's display it's is so low you can't see in sun light, low display brightness is most difficult as compared to other phone .
"
275,"  Every thing is good and awsome look but only one disadvantages is that it doesn't have mi remote sensors. MI phone are mainly famous for mi remote. And this redmi 9 phone is too long and according to long it's width is low. It look awkward.
"
276,"  The said phone which I ordered on October 2021 received without any problem from Amazon. Every thing is ok but the camera quality is very poor also it looks like a cheap one due to his plastic cabinet. Over all it's good not the best one.
"
277,"  I am using this mobile for a week. It is fast and a really good mobile at this price. It does not have a good camera as it's so much time to focus. And if you look closely, you can see the pixels. But 6GB ram and 128Gb memory at this price, I mean common something has to be bad. If you are not a selfie guy and want performance this is for you at this budget. It is not for selfie queens or cool selfie chapris. Lol.
"
278,"  I am using Xiaomi phones from a long time and I always recommend to buy Xiaomi phones because it gives you the same features at lowest price than other brands. The build quality of the phone is good, the camera quality is nice at this price range and it have a big battery life. Just giving 4 stars because I didn't find any discount deal on it.
"
279,"  Redmi phone are always best.
"
280,"  I had to return because the video were having issue while recording, some times voice will not come, sometimes it says format not supported when i try to play the video. I got a replacement mobile today on 13 sep 2021. When i checked it the volume of recorded video is very low. I requested for refund. This phone has this problem so beware before you order
"
281,"  Very worst products.. With in a week automatically switch off.. Headphone pin damaged....fingerprint not working...if I buy in shops....I will slap to shop owner....for given this worst mobile....
"
282,"  The camera quality is very very poor and per details of phone .. back and front camera bothHeating problem is there while gaming ..The quality is so much decrease by redmi..So waste of money now for redmi mobiles ..Paisa waste phone .. So dont buy this phone
"
283,"  Poor camera,  screen resolution not good, 2 day used after i realised it is worst phone ever  and most important we can't return it. So don't waste your money redmi phones quality down day by day. Purchase other companies phone and good luck.
"
284,"  Best buy at this price! The display quality is amazing and I do not have any complaint with the camera too. There is no other phone available at this price which comes with 4GB ram. You should go ahead with this.
"
285,"  Each and every time, the Microsoft Teams app is to be reinstalled and this makes the kids very difficult to attend the online classes in time. It also took a lot of time installing Bank of India app.NOT A PROPER SOFTWARE IN IT
"
286,"  Mobile becomes slow time to time and hangs often. I think it is poor in speed than other mobile of redmi like mi 4a. I am disappointed. Battery life good. Camera quality is not bad.
"
287,"  Not recommended for heavy user's/gamers.Goo for average use..Good 🔋 lifeCamera needs improvementAwesome built designFingerprint scanner sometimes not recognise
"
288,"  Heating problem - Once call is ended the mobile get heated & same with charging time.Slow battery charging - Kept the phone for charging at 15% remaining and after 20 minutes the battery charge was 29%. Means battery percent was not increasing and it take more than a minute to charge 1%
"
289,"  Please if you are someone who is dependent on phone for work purpose, Don't buy this you can invest in better phone. Phone is too slow and I bought this on 4th Feb and today 25th Feb the phone is dead and not charging. It hangs most of thee time and There has been a lot of network issue, receiver not able to hear (Its not the SIM problem). Veryyy bad experience with this phone. Super disappointed.
"
290,"  The battery of this mobile is good but the processor is slow on using heavy apps and the touch is not that responsive when using some of the live tv apps. Overall at this budget dont expect this mobile to do heavy taks smoothly and I am giving my review after using this mobile for over 2 months.

"
293,"   Faulty Device delivered with serious charging issues. The phone got bend while charging and now we are supposed to pay the service charge for companies or sellers mistake. The service charge cost more than 25% of phones total price and customer care says it is out of warranty because of bend issue even when there are no other screen damages or anything which looks like a customer issue. Worst seller and worst customer support. I demand a compensation for my loss
"
294,"  Best mobile configuration in this cost segment.If you expect good camera quality then check the pixel before buying.Satisfactory image quality found.Front camera is a bit dull though the back camera of 13+2 MP makes it over.Overall nice experience and satisfied with the purchase till now.
"
295,"  The phone I received was really very nice. The processor and the camera was excellent. I am using it since a month and the I experienced a very nice relaxation while using the phone. The quality of this phone is excellent. The fingerprint reader is just superb feature of this phone.
"
296,"  At this price range the phone is not bad at all. The processor is not that quick but okay for normal use. Camera quality is neither good nor bad. Less metal and more plastic.
"
297,"  Worst camera and speaker quality, I want to  return and asking for refund but Amazon did not provide the refund option only replacement available for  this mobile, I am wasted my money by purchasing this mobile, very bad experience
"
298,"  So I Used this phone and I would like to clear one thing that If you want to take a phone for clicking photos then I seriously recommend you to take other phone but if you ask me about its performance then see G35 is not so good processor so if you need a gaming phone which will perform well for atleast 1 year on medium or high graphics then don't buy this and storage is 128GB so it's good
"
299,"  HeyHighly recommend if you are a Buddha or buddhi but if you are young go for any 3gb ram phone instead of this as it doesn’t look premium where as other phone have that looksBut if you have to do heavy work ya it can do that but only thing the camera quality is really bad one
"
300,"  Camera is below average. Battery back up is too food and it does not hang as it has g80 helio chipset. I am disappointed only about the camera. otherwide ot os a noce mpbile considering the budget. One mpre thong.. when i checked the IMEI, it gave me no data regarding brand name or model number. May be a duplicateobile is delivered to me.
"
301,"  After reading many negative reviews was a bit worried whether the selection of this model was good or bad.But after getting in hand, I can say really 100% that it's a worth for those who don't use smartphones much in detail like camera and all,Feature wise it's a good phone at a nominal price. Operating is good, camera a bit ok ok.Overall rating will be ""Good""
"
302,"  Good product

"
305,"   It’s a good one in case you buy it as your secondary one… For primary purpose you can stretch the budget and you’ll get better options.
"
306,"  After using this phone, I'm really disappointed with it. This doesn't give me any satisfaction which I want from this phone. The camera is okay only in daylight. And also it looks like it has 3 cameras but actually it only has 2 cameras. The sound quality is also not satisfying. My redmi 8 is much better than this. Touch and fingerprint is okay. But I'm not satisfied.
"
307,"  Not price worthy.1. The camera quality is very cheap.(remember VJA camera 10 years before. It is Just few levels upper in this phone)2. Display is quite low in comparison to Samsung phones like m10 or m20, 21 etc.3. Still the battery life is quite good . But who knows what will happen after use for 2-3 months.Price should be reduced in comparison to qualities of above points.
"
308,"  Don't purchase red mi this mobile worst battery life i was purchase 1st week of November 2021 but still date battery not working i cant return the item their is no warranty service.no body response if in case desis of mobile with in warranty period also no response.No physical damage this phone but still  CHARGER PIN  not working yet.worst experience with RED Mi
"
309,"  Although its battery backup is very nice and last for at least one day and miui 12 is also gives smooth display but one thing that should be fixed is face unlock is not working properly it unlocks with two different person of slightly same characters
"
310,"  I purchased this mobile in exchange with old phone.This is really very good phone in use by feature.Service given by the sellers is very good and really impressive and fast delivery.Really Suggested this for future buying..
"
311,"  After 1 week of usage I am writing review.Camera , screen resolution, video , gaming experience all are nice.Battery charging taking little time than my expectations.But value for money.I was comparing mi 8A dual & 9A &9 primeBut finally purchased this one as per my preference.Thanks Amazon for prompt Delivery !
"
312,"  Mi phone is value for money phone especially redmi 9 if you think about phone in 10k range i suggest u redmi 9 this phone has good looking phone battery life is to long and display quality feel better than another phone and processor is good #Redmi9
"
313,"  I read the reviews after booking the phone and was kind of dismayed. But the phone turned out to be too good for me. Especially in this budget with all these specifications Redmi 9 stands tall among the competitors. As most of the reviews the camera is not supreme but it is appreciable in such a prize. The fingerprint quality, processor and battery life are all very satisfactory.
"
314,"  Pic quality moderate. Notice in uploaded pic, idol is not clearly visible despite adequate lighting. IR blaster not present. Also magnetic sensor absent . It's used in compass app.
"
315,"  PHONE IS WORTH OF MONEY BUY CAMERA IS LIKE 1.5 MP , PROCESSOR IS SLOW GAMER NOT BUY IT SPACE IS GOOD , RAM CLOCK SPEED IS LOW.BUT FOR SMALL BUDGET ITS CHUMMESWARI PHONE
"
316,"  Well Redmi 9 is very nice mobile for this price segment.Review after 2 month and look like working good but bit bulky.Camera is good but not best, not recommended for camera lovers.Battery work good and charging time also not take much time.I recommend for whom not so techno savvy.
"
317,"  I loved the mobile and it's very super fast.  Little weight on the mobile and it's okay.  It has free space and cleaning further is easy. Overall its very good.
"
318,"  The phone is really choppy and not good for this price. There are better phone of realme available like the narzo series.Go for them instead of this
"
319,"  Redmi still using old USB Chargers not C Cable for even new models, USB Chargers won’t last long and always develops faults after some usage so ideally MI wants to u to buy new phones every month. Going to tweet to MI India Boss
"
320,"  Don't buy MI phones. There are lot of Mother board issues. Worst service. They will charge for checking also. They ultimately steal money even your phone is in warranty.
"
321,"  Untill redmi stops barging into all private spaces with ads, user will be dissatisfied in a corner using a best phone for given price. Everything is great except those annoying ads. Why can't everything be stock android ?
"
322,"  This is a good low budget phone. But after a heavy work UI gets a 1sec delay. This device is only for simple works.The camera quality is very poor, sound quality is bad.
"
323,"  Not worthy for 8999/-Battery capacity is not upto the markScreen scrolling is always laggy Even the company creates a replacement policy of a few days so that a customer could not replace this mobile . Good job Amazon employees u guys suck
"
324,"  I want to gift this on raksha bandhan but product accessories missing even i told that I will take replacement only raksha bandhan 22nd aug other wise I want refund because after 22nd no means of the replacement... So please refund me
"
325,"  I've got this mobile for rupees 7600...so, i didn't have much expectations from this but this phone is very good for regular use. I gifted it to my father, he is very happy with itBig and clear screenGood batteryGood lookingBut is has poor camera...like worst.
"
326,"  Not purchase this product  running products automatically off after use 7 days this produtt is very bad mi service center is no response  iam all ready mail dropped mi service center is but no response  shopping experience Amazon partner is  very bed is very chip vander iam leaving Amazon aap permanentThis is phone is very bed company is very cheap bothoffu Amazon &mi
"
327,"  The camera is so blurry. Absolutely nothing like the pics. The battery is a beast though. The big screen is a potential plus, or minus depending on how you choose to look at it. The colors are a bit dull, but that's just typical Mi colors. Decent buy for the price range.
"
328,"  Price is high. It should have been 9000 maximum
"
329,"  Its very beautiful and very excellent super fast battery life good also improve more long battery life and its compitable with my google meet and zoom classes anyways it was a good and excellent fast mobile in the world
"
330,"  I you Have 9000 rupees and want to buy smartphone which have 4Gb ram and 64 Gb storage, please Don't buy this smartphone . Go with any other smartphones other then redmi because After some time this phone will be lagging and running slow, apps will open slowly , and also it's camera is worst part of this phone . It has only Good battery and Stylish look .
"
331,"  Auto restart in 30 seconds. After reset contact saving problem & other problems are found. Very disappointed with it. Technical person are available for visit. Disappointed from Amazon service also.
"
332,"  The most affordable 4+64 variant in all brands in the sale. The looks is awesome being an budget device. Great battery life and screen quality. Camera is okay but not great.
"
333,"  Poor display, eyes are getting effected. Poor speakers. Poor camera.Performance is fast as it has 4Gb other than that its not recommended product.
"
334,"  Overall nice product but battery charging is too slow. As stated in specs. 5000 mAh battery but it draining so quickly as compared to 5000mAh power.
"

"
343,"  Phone is good. Processing speed is ok but the camera is worst. If you love taking pictures then it's not for you. Believe me you'll regret if you buy it. On the other hand if you are going it for parents or anyone elder in your family then its good for their use.
"
344,"  The phone's good. It works well for daily use. There are some problems though.1. When charging, the adaptor and the phone heat up. The adaptor gets really really hot. It feels like it's gonna explode.2. It freezes for like a second or 2. (After just 3 days)3. The processor isn't that great and the camera too.
"
345,"  Just go for it if you are looking for a mobile with all those necessary features. Camera quality is decent and not that well if you are looking for a handset with best in class camera. Otherwise it is decent in looks and performance.! Overall it's a like from my side..!!

"
353,"  This review about bought after 3 months. Good sound. Camera is ok but not good. Awesome batter life- good stand by. Budget mobile. My suggestion is that put D+ temper glass(150 rs only), don't use normal temper. D+ is much stronger and long laster, hard to break the glass when mobile slip down to the floor and no air enter between temper and display glass.
"
354,"  Battery life good.  Camera results very awful. Display very bad. I recommend don't buy this mobile phone because you will not able to return it and mobile is not joyful.

"
357,"  The product is very easy to use. All the features are excellent . Camera is good . The best thing is about the battery. It is only for normal use.If you want to use the phone for gaming purpose , then the phone might overheat and the battery will drain very fast.
"
358,"  Superb performance . Beautiful design, excellent screen, original warranty card. No back cover. No head phones
"

386,"  The phone is quite good for the the price I paid however I absolutely hate that it does not have split screen option and does not support 5ghz bandwidth either.. other cheaper phones have those yet redmi 9 doesn't.Apart from that the phone is running good.. worth the money if the above two things are added.
"
387,"  Worst camera........ Higly disappointed😞😞😞..Display quality is also very poor.. Running video in 720p feels like running it in 240p...😡 Display is dull.....If you have a photographer in you even by 1%, don't even think about buying this phone....It is basically a scam...There is also NO RETURN POLICY by Amazon.

"
427,"  Please go for realme c3. Don't go for this phone as realme c3 is with G70 at same price and very good camera quality as compared to this phone which has G35 processor which is quite laggy sometimes.

I've been using it for my online classes these months and it performs really good. The camera quality is not extraordinary. But it's upto the mark.

If display updates are not given it is waste to buy this phone.

"
452,"  Dont buy anything from amazon. If product is defective, the amazon replacmnt policy is worst. Amazon arrnge a inspection.....  A technician inspect your phone..

"
460,"  Within one month FInd my device is not working properly and I was forced to factory reset and smart messing it needs to be improved. Both the issues not because of the device because of the MIUI operating system that need to be rectified.

"
491,"  If you want to play pubg, Fo t buy this phone it doesn't have gyroscope sensor and screen display is low camera is worst never expected this from Redmi, battery is just for saying 5000 mah but its not that up to the point. Go for some upgraded phones by adding 1-2K more in which you will got more

"
495,"  #Redmi_9 marvelous phoneMarvelous battery lifeMarvelous camera and phone performanceValue for money also
"
496,"  I received the product in time and in original sealed box but the touch sometimes did not work. The problem was solved by Redmi service center after replacing the touch and display as without any cost.
"
497,"  Good phone in the price range but not the best. I'm using redmi for six years or more & experienced several models, the main issue is their buggy MIUI, always a new update comes with some solved old bug but with some new bugs as well as!
"

"
504,"  Perfect product for your mom or dad who uses it only for whatsApp and YouTube. Battery life is good, stands for 1.5 days. Camera gives VGA quality but that's ok considering the price. Battery heats up if you views videos in 1080p. No lag though.
"
505,"  It's not fast charging ,is taking too much time for 100% charging.Touch sense  not goodI am going to replace it are giving back,I was using redmi y2 which I byback with thise edmi 9,Redmi 9 much slower than y2 it's avareg phone. Very unhappy.

"
510,"  Nice phone in this budget although in the back side they've shown 3 cameras + flash but in the actual there are 2 cameras and 1 dummy.They should've provided type C charger point instead of B type.Display size is attractive enough.
"
511,"  Battery life is so bad.. Draining very fast, charging takes more time. YouTube while watching shorts it hangs. Gaming is only ok, it's something like a second hand product. Too bad... Please look for any other models comes in this price range.
"
512,"  We didn't received any add on service like the back case of the phone. We really regret this as we compared with other phones in same brand or the other brand they all receive mostly both back case and tempered glass. If possible you may send us seperately the back case.......
"
513,"  Really good budget phone..excellent display at this budget and more over its 4gb 64gb we wont get any phones at this budget..camera quality is also excellent guys its very good and value for money

"
515,"  1. Battery life is excellent2. fingerprint reader works fine3. camera quality is below average4. performance is average5. display quality is not that goodGood for normal use only. If you love to take picture and play games don't go for it.

"
517,"  The product is an item of handsome features and all of them are running very satisfactory  Overall it can be defined as a ""Paisa Vasool"" deal.
"
518,"  Great device at such a price. Loved the look, colour and the touch response is really fast. Factory settings have provided everything we need. Thanks a lot for the deal amazon and Xiaomi.
"
519,"  I bought two phones for my parents. Orange and blue color. I liked both the colors. It's a VFM phone. Your budget is limited then go for it without a second thought.
"
520,"  I think i have received a defective piece as there is some problem is coming in screen and battery whereas no complaints comes in Readme Phones but zero percent satisfied with this phone.
"
521,"  It is a budget phone but it feels cheaper to the touch.... Well designed and smooth to the touch .. only problem is the battery... I drains quicker then expected but for the amout i paid for the product... It was worth it
"
522,"  Team ""Colour of this phone is not as per the displayed picture colour"" it's totally different...You had mentioned ""Sporty Orange"" n in reality it's ""dark orange""...Also Quality of Camera pictures are worst then a normal base model...Not a Worth spending any money on this..
"
523,"  It's not working properly. Sometimes breaking voice. Could not move quickly from one application to other application... It stucks most of the times... Old chargers were sent.... What else to say.... It's not worth to buy... Return period is so. Less....couldn't return it...
"
524,"  It's just been 30 min since I unboxed the phone and I'm not happy with the performance of the phone. I have not been given option to return the phone which I would want to. Online shopping is such a scam. Would suggest not to buy anything from Amazon.
"
525,"  Finger print reader, very nicely working.Battery life, good.Camera quality,  Average. Below expected.
"
526,"  I have order this mobile it doesn't detect 5g WiFi net work I called the amazon and replaced.But the replaced one also same problem so I have returned the item.The latest mobile which cannot detect the 5g wifi its really useless. Don't buy this model.

"
536,"  Value for money. Only thing it has a tag/ image of china which is disgusting because the country does not have transparency.
"
537,"  Allover phone is good, you can go for it if you're looking under 10000/- but you have to sacrifice with the camara quality.. camara quality is not so much good as i expected from redmi.
"
538,"  I like this mobile very much because of the battery standby time. I have bought it for my kids online class. The battery charge decreases 20% only after using 4 hours of online class. This is very fine when compared with other mobiles.

"
572,"  I bought this Phone but from day one it has problems, while playing video it will have glitches in everything so got it exchanged the exchanhed one has the same problem, this one is slower and has even more problems, the keypad doesn't work and it not worth the investment.

"
576,"  It looks sleek and works fine. The camera certainly is a bummer. Does not take good pics at all.
"
577,"  Simple review, not a product to buy as a phone.You have other options, please go for that. Even sound is not loud, not clear enough in speaker mode. Camera is really worst. I'm still confused is it 1mp camera or 12 mp Or 48 mp in any condition.If you love xiaomi products, this is will be the first who disappoint you.
