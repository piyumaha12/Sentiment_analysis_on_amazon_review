  Don’t buy this product .Image quality is below average comparing with the specification. Useless camera.And there is NO RETURN POLICY and replacing with same mobile is big headache .DON’T buy this mobile
  Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳 Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain "cool" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾 The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.
  Very bad experience from Amazon. Very bad camera quality of the phone. I want to return the phone, but amazon is not taking back the phone. I don't want to purchase any product from amazon further. Leaving amazon app permanently
  Best buy at this price! The display quality is amazing and I do not have any complaint with the camera too. There is no other phone available at this price which comes with 4GB ram. You should go ahead with this.
  i didn't upload photo ....for any reason but it is not up to the mark .1.display 4/52.cam 3/53.fing sens.. 4.5/54.processor 3/55.build quality 3.75/5back panel is not good looking coz some self design as per my opinionin this price segment rs 9000 is good enough
  This phone is not value for moneyIts a downgraded phone of earlier phone launched in india.The camera is worst i ever seen in any redmi phone.Battery is ok.The display quality is very bad not hd. Watching videos on YouTube feels like watching 3gp videos.Dot notch display is ok in lookwise but not good in quality.Sometimes 4gb ram feels like 2gb.I am very disappointed by the camera quality of this phone.12 megapixel feels like 2MP camera.Recently i am using redmi note 5 pro. And this phone is just downgraded phone by redmi .you cannot imagine low light photography in this phone.The back plastic body feels like a cheap phone.If you really need a phone there are many options in the market.If you are taking phone for the first and a beginner you can go for redmi 9 prime.
  Good product value for money but ordering is too difficult within one minute soldout
  Product is best at this price but charging speed is very slow but we cannot accept more then this at this price
  Good mobile
  Processor is bit slow, camera is below average except that everthing works fine. I personally don't like MIUI because of lots of ads and bloatwares. But, good budget range phone if you ignore/adjust this issues.

   Barely two odd weeks into my purchase, my phone faced a software glitch. The phone refused to boot. It was stuck at opening "Redmi" stage. Even when I pressed on OFF button, the phone switched on by itself, refusing to reboot beyond the first step. Eventually it got hot. I dropped it by mistake when I picked up the hot phone and it landed on my wooden floor. It split into two and caught fire. My floor got damaged. Thankfully it did not explode. No one was injured. I want the company to contact me and give me an explanation why it caught fire.
  Very very Poor Mobile. If you have used any FHD mobile phones then I bet you that you can't use this phone for more than a Hour.PROSBattery. 👍🏻👍🏻Sleek design. 👍🏻Call quality 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻CONSWorst Display ever seen. YouTube videos👎🏻👎🏻Processor is Pathetic. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻Camera Front is just okay. Back total failure.👎🏻Poor Internet connectivity. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻Nothing inside the box. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻Please don't think of buy this phone. 100% you will regret. MADE IN CHINA product. They mentioned as INDIA everywhere but the Mobile. Soft cover shows MADE IN CHINA. Rs.8998 is wasted..You can buy for a elderly person who use only for Call purpose. Better Don't Buy 😂😂😂
  Overall its good and satisfied for the price.Pros:1. Good Battery.2. Best budget phone for 8999 with 4GB RAM and 64GB Internal Memory.The only drawback i felt is Camera.If you are looking for a better camera I would suggest to pick some other model.
  best good product prive battry camera all very good
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   Auto response start problem with start mobile
  It got so many bugs, the screen turned completely blank when i clicked on 'update system app', surprisingly NO heating issues, brightness is lowFor camera the rear is okay but front lacks details
  It is  a good phone which is orange a nice colour I love it it features are better than other phones
  Worst product ever as the camera quality is very poort rear as well as front. Amazon was not ready to take the return as they have a new policy now which is replacement policy so they will get you a replacement but won't take it back. Bought that in sale as had heard from friends that redmi phones are good but it ain't. Will suggest not to buy at all from Amazon as it's better to go and buy from the store atleast they take 500rs and will exchange the product. Speaker is poor you can not hear properly on speaker at all. Product is not worth in this price range as one can get better options by payin 1000-2000 bucks extra.
  Good product. Value for money phone. Everything is average. Display is good. Battery life is also good. I bought it for a employee of mine. Overall a good phone. 4/64 combo is hard to  find in this price range. Exceeded my expectations.
  It is a just ok kind of phone. Camera is very pathetic. I did not expect this type of camera in this phone. Even my old redmi 4a mobile is better in camera than this. Apart from camera, I could see there is some lag in the screen while moving to different pages though it has 4GB RAM. Better choose some other phone than this. It has no notification light and has a micro USB charging port. No night mode in camera.Update after using it for 20 days: the phone gets lagging all the time no matter what ever the app you use. It is completely waste of money. Do not buy this mobile.
  First Of All I Bought This for my Dad against his old MI 5A .I Got This For 6800 Only.Please Dont This in Buy in 9000/-.My Review Scores Are-Battery Backup- 10/10Storage - 10/10Camera - Rear(7/10);Front(5/10)Sensers - 10/10Build Quality - 10/10Looks - 10/10Performance -9/10(Not Gaming Type Phone Cause G35)Overall Suggestion Is :You Should Buy If●You Are Normal User who wants long battery backup(WA/FB/Insta/Uthoob/Calls)●Looks Matters●You Are Not " Selfie-Lover " Type PersonYou Shouldn't Buy If●You have hardcore needs like video editing,coding, designing●You Are Hardcore Gamer●You Are "Selfie Wala Person"Thankyou😎P.S:- You Can Consider Redmi 9 Prime If You Are Second Category😁
  My suggestion for everyone who is thinking to buy redmi 9, please don't buy.Redmi is a very trust brand but not redmi 9.I purchased this phone 3weeks ago, first it was in good condition, after 3 week it started to hang every morning, after 4 days the phone completely shutdown.I don't know what to do, before getting one month this happened.It's getting really hurt to use this phone.
  Redmi9Too many disadvantagesCamera quality is worst:both front and rear.Processor is very slow.Body is plastic and which is uselessDisplay quality is very badMicro usb charger: this wonder, since all model new phones are coming with c-port, but this phone with old model micro usb port.Video calling is issue.Heating issue during charge aswell as during the call,You can't video call and many more issue.And you can't return the phone in Amazon.Totally this phone is gutterchap quality.
  G35 is ok for day to day usage not highly capable..
  Best mobile ,best service currior boy
  Best mobile under 10000 💖💖💖
  Xiaomi has provided a magnificent smartphone in low budget section with increadible feature and great visual asthetics.Pros:-1. 4gb DDR4 RAM faster then SD 6xx series2. 64GB storage3. Under 9000 INR4. 5000 mAh battery ( however the chipset consume more battery as compared to SD with 4000mAh battery will perform the same)5. Fast charging support (Definitely buy a fast charger for great experience)6. MiUI 12 is simply clean and loaded with features. Seamlessly switch from provios mi phoneCons:-1. Battery sucking chipset Helio G35, not optimize for gaming.2. Lack of notifications light(small but deadly features, you will miss it quite often)3. 264ppi display for 720p resolution looks crupmy at this huge size.4. Poor quality made in india accesories.5. Building quality is poor. As well as camera are very dissatisfied.6. Useless camera bump for 2 poor camera only just for marketing showing 3 circles.7. Loaded with bloatware and adware. Unauthorised data transfer to China.If possible go for Motorola E7 around the same price and you will have great experience with Snapdragon and clean android experience.
  Overall good mobile...But Camera not good as expected.Overall Performance is good .Value For Money
  I was having Samsung before same 4gb ram and battery back was very good but in redmi with out much of space or app ram speed is very very slow and battery back up draing with a day so not happy with the redmi product .I can return to Amazon with in 7 days but unfortunately our building is effected with covid possiitive so totally issulated no one should have contact with us so can't able to send the return mobile
  Charging Adapter came with phone turned out to be defective. stopped working after 2 weeks of purchase.Don't know how to return the adapter or how to claim the warranty on adapter alone.Phone is working fine so far and looks good
  Very very poor camera.its look like jio 1500/- camera and supplier not responded regarding this issue
  The phone is very hang and some application doesn't work properly....Pls don't buy this ....If you are try to return it will having lots of stages and procedures.The performance of this phone is very bad...Redmi provide 4gb ram but it having Below 2 gb experience...Poor network connectivity and some times it showing blank screen...Very waste products...and big lose of money.........
  This is my review after 1 year of purchaseProsDisplay 4/5Speaker 4/5Finger print scanner 5/5Battery backup 5/5Phone is good if you are a beginner to touch phone, the helio g35 processor is good for day to day task but there is some hanging problem but too rare, ram management is not upto mark, some time google browser crashesh, camera is below average you can take photo by managing. There is some bugs in miuiConclusionIf you need a phone for study puposes go for itAnd if you are a casual user then go for itOtherwise don't look into this
  Cons :- Orange Back different from that shown in product pictures. Not attractive.- No battery charging indicator light.Once the mobile goes in sleep mode, you cannot figure if it is charging or not.- Defective Sound System : volume is generally low. No Bass At All. Sound Volume goes up and down on its own while playing songs/video.- Extremely Short (half meter) charging cable- Micro-USB B-type port- Outdated handset. Not worth the money.- No RETURN Option despite receiving defective piece- No Option to schedule technician visit before replacement window closes (all slots permanently full)Stuck with a defective handset.No scope of Return & purchasing another model.This feels like fraud.Disappointed with Amazon for the first time.
  Phone is only for Calling, Whats App and Youtube.I gifted this phone to my mother, so as per her usage i felt its okay.Worst part is camera.... I even had Redmi Note 4.... I seriously felt Note 4  camera is much better that redmi 9.I got this phone in 7500/-
  If you ignore this review, you ll end up regretting. Camera quality of this phone is worse than you'd have ever had. If you click a selfie you'll look an old person. No color, no texture. You can say that it's a budget phone and all that. That's true but even a simple one megapixel camera has 100 times better camera. Not exaggerating.Battery also a bit weak. Don't buy
  I received the producton 18 th October 2021 . I was very happy with this., But suddenly on 4th November the colour disappeared look's like negative. I wrote Amazon team for the difficult & return back . Till today no response coming from Amazon team. Although I am a prime member & also items purchased more than 1200 or more. Lastly Amazon chitted me at least no single reply since 4th November 2021. How can we people trust? Thanks to Amazon team.
  I would like to take a a few mins to write a review if this phone and Amazon service to alert everyone. Please do not but this phone if you would like to have some peace.Worst camera clarity and even more worse phone condition.Phone is heating up when charging.On top Amazon service is worse than ever to resolve this with a new phone Samsung.Disgusting customer service with in professional mannerism of agent by Amazon.
  ====== waste of money ========1. Camera quality is very poor even 5K range phone camera is better than this.2. No full features of MIUI 12- > Clock icon is not real-time like in other Mi phones. > No one hand mode which is part of MIUI 12 so u cant operate this phone with a single hand.3. Display is also very poor means pixelated and no true colors.4. FM is not wireless works only with wired Headphone
  This is a very good product with low price. Thanks Amazon and Redmi Mobile for this product.Excellent looks and colour and awesome features.I love this product too much thanks Amazon again.
  For a price this low along with exchange offer is a winner. No one likes to keep the old phone and buy a new one. If they dont the mobile phones will keep piling at home. I bought this for mywife and she is pretty pleased with the buy.This is indeed value for money if you keep in mind what are your needs from a phone.
  phone is good. works smooth. but camera is very disappointing....
  Never trust redmi
  Battery performance is not good camera quality is not good also there is no brightness in my device I don't want this mobile
  What is main use of a phone?...obviously to receive and make calls....if you are not able hear anything properly then whats the use of a phone. Call speaker volume (internal) is toooooo less. It is so irritating. I wasted my money on this phone. Only the battery backup is good. Rest i wasted my money on this. The phone is unnecessarily too heavy. I should have spended extra 1200 rupees and bought Samsung M series phone rather than this worthless phone.
  If there is an option I would 3.5It's been 2 days since I got the phone and here are positive and negatives with comparison to Redmi 8a Dual (my previous phone)Battery Charging: first 30-40% is very quick in charging. But to get it fully charged it takes almost an hour.Battery Life: It runs for more than 24 hours once fully charged even if you use it to watch movies and games.Negative : phone gets heated up while charging if you leave it on cushion type surfaces like bed, sofa etc. Irrespective of the surface phone gets a little bit heated up every time you charge it. And if you try answering a call or use the phone while on charge get ready for hand and ear burning sensation.This is not observered in Redmi 8a Dual. But the battery life is less competed to Redmi 9. If you are a person who uses mobile while on charge, then I won't recommend Redmi 9.Camera Quality: if you are buying this phone for Camera.. DO NOT. Redmi 8a Dual has better selfi and rear camera quality. Selfie camera is worst and rear works on in perfect lighting and when you try to zoom on objects it looses it's quality.Storage: Go for it.Volume: Good but when compared to Redmi 8a dual it's little bit low.Overall if Redmi 8a Dual is much better than Redmi 9. Except for the storage and battery life.
  Mobile screen in good,battery backup excelent,Daily usage good,Gaming experience Laggy PUBG, Call of Duty is almost not possible to play in this game,it has 4gb RAM but still not good enough to handle gamesCamera quality is worst, not even near to expectations.Chinese's knows well how to attract Indians, Camera Megapixel, Camera filter, sound, Big screen and very common attractive looks.for normal usage like calling messaging, whatsapp and all this device is more then enough,If you are game lover or photography lover this device is not at all for you,If you just want a decent android mobile for daily usage its good
  Nice product
  Within a week after the phone purhase I faced a defect in navigation software which is crucial in today's time.. couldn't return as it expired 48hrs delivery time.. went to service center and they couldn't fix the phone defect in 1 week as promised.. I argued and they gave me a new phone in same model for usage meanwhile my actual phone is being repaired.. found the same defect in new phone as well.. my issue still hasn't been resolved from the Redmi company.. bad phone and service.
  Never falling for cheap price again. I got it for 7149₹ at sale with extra 10% card discount. It was good for couple of months. Then it started showing some issues. I bought 4gb ram variant. Yet it got slower than my old phone which is 2gb ram. My old phone's camera is Front 2mp and Rear 8mp. But still my older phone gives much better image till date. My older phone's battery was 2400mah, and again Redmi 9 last only till evening, when charged in morning. Whereas my older phone lasted till Night with remaining 20-30% battery.I thought I was upgrading to a better phone, but no, I paid over 7000₹ for phone that is worse than my 5 year old phone. All the fancy features are nothing but gimmicks to attract customers. It's a cheap phone, that obviously have cheap parts in it. That will work fine for sometime but eventually devolve.
  I used to have a Motorola Moto G5S Plus phone as a secondary phone and recently i changed this to Redmi 9. Here are the advantages and disadvantages. This is assembled in India and is a good value for money offering.Advantages1) I wanted to replace the phone with the cheaptest entry point phone with a good display.  The Redmi offer HD+ not full HD, but it is okay for my usage.2) The MIUI is extremely pleasing to the eye and gives a good user experience.3) The ease of set up of Redmi 9 was awesome. It was a dual SIM phone with Volte and 4 G SIM support on both SIM4) Also we can extend the existing 64 GB storage with upto 512 GB SD card, I have procured another 64 GB storage5) It has an FM radio thrown in as well.6) The camera is okay not highly fancy similar to the Redmi 9 Power, but this being a secondary phone I am okay with the overal performance.Disadvantages1) The charger is the only mini USB and wish this was a USB C type charge with quick charge.2) The Wifi detects only 2.4 GHz and not the latest 5GHz hence the overall connectivty speed is low.For the price point that is 2500 Rs less due to exchange and overall pay out to be around 6150 Rs, this phone is a value for money offering. At the time of buying this was the top phone in the Amazon phone range, but given a choice would have opted for Redmi 9 Power, that had a better feature.
  I just bought and unboxed it.its a budget friendly Smartphone. in this box contains a Smart Phone,Sim Ejecter Pin,10 W Charger,Micro USB Cable for Charging.HD plus DisplayAnd Operating system is Xiaomi Latest user interface MI UI12 .Water Coating ,in this price range its display and sound is not bad.And better experience.Demerrits is  Not a fast charger ,IR Blaster feature is not available.It is not a big demerrits .in this price this is an amazing smartphone.I liked this Phone and recommend my friends because its a budget smartphone.Now many phones provided everything good  more than redmi 9.i repeat its a budget smartphone. That because i recommend my friends.  Anything i missed discuss to you ,sorry about that.  Thankfully  Amazon Customer  More Than Amazon Lover
  This phone is a budget smartphone with decent performance. I am using this phone for last 3 months so I am sharing my views basis my experience. If you are bying it for regular uasge like calls, watching YouTube and whatsapp then it's good. Don't consider this phone for gaming or heavy usage as it lags then. I hav bought this phone for my son for his online classes, calls and for YouTube videos so it's working fine.
  Third grade phone from MI Looks like 2 years old technology used in phone micro USB charging point in phone very very slow charging... Even 6k phones from mi r giving c type charging in phones.the camera quality is so pathatic that any 5/6 k cheap phone can click better image than this,really wanted to return the product n get my money back to buy another set but there is no option to get the money back.Shame on u mi using more than 2 years old tech in ur new phones.
  I have checked it myself that the second space feature is not available in this phone. MI customer care is saying it has second space and service centre saying it does not have . I did not find any better solution other than returning it because a brand like MI is misguiding customers. The hardware is so downgraded that it cannot handle second space . So they have removed the feature from this phone which is available in each and every phone running MIUI. Worst experience ever ......
  Pros :1: Sharp display despite only being Hd+ instead of FHD+2: Decent gaming processor , guarantees a smooth 50+ fps gameplay on many games3: fast storage , ram and is somewhat bloat free with a really good OS skin4: Really nice grippy texture5: Above average speakersCons :1: Average camera (though that's expected)2: Doesn't have full fledged fast charging so may take upto 2 hours for a full charge3: No earphones in box (but most people don't use stock earphones anyways)Verdict : Really good phone for a tight budget of 11k but if you chip in 5k more the Redmi note 10 is a good choice as wellNonetheless an all round good phone at its price range
  First of all, product launched in September 2021 with old version of Android android 10 while android 11 was in market. They are not providing update of android 10 to 11. It is that slow, even YouTube struck.  It feels that I am running a Chinese mobile of year 2010.Don't buy it guys. Just for the sake of large customer base Redmi is in unethical business.Guys don't fall prey to Redmi's trap.
  Don't get fooled guys by redmi 9 activ and amazon, The display as well as camera quality is disappointing. Their is very poor display with extremely poor brightness. Unless you switch it to maximum the display lacks brightness. Also the camera quality is extremely disappinting, both the front as well as back camera. Return policy is not applicable and only replacement is possible with same mobile and that too in the case of recieving only damaged product. Here also the customer will be feeling like befooled as once purchased the mobile, it can not be returned at any cost. Very much disappointed with MI as well as Amazon. No where they have mentioned clearly that the mobile can not be returned except for damage, only they are mentioning that 7 days replacement is possible making it dubious for customers. Kind of feeling cheated withAmazon as When I have resources available but still will have to bear with a lower end mobile whose performance is not at par just because it can not be replaced by Amazon. Not sure when Amazon started these cheap kind of gimmicks erasing it's brand name. No support by Amazon for this kind of performance/satisfaction issue with product. Think twice before purchasing this redmi 9 activ mobile. Only if you have budget issues then only buy this mobile. Because once bought it can not be returned. The phone is lagging in speed also. Their seems issue with power button too. Overall the quality of the mobile is compromised too much and a much better mobile can be bought at this price(6gb + 128gb) waste of money
  *Till date this is one of the worst phone, I ever purchased.!!!*Definitely not recommended.*Doesn't support split screen for using two apps simultaneously!*EA games keeps hanging in this phone.*Camera quality is worst!!
  I write this review after using the mobile for 14 days, first 2 weeks it's awesome 😍, after that the mobile is getting OFF automatically & after few minutes getting ON, I thought this might happen as a new handset that comes with few updates. Then after 17 days the mobile got OFF & never ON again. I visited Mi service center they said the mother board is damaged, they kept the handset & asked for 1 week minimum for recovery. This is the worst 😭experience with Amazon & Mi India.
  am using amazon for the past 8 Years, today i have faced a really bad experience.i have received a faulty mobile, i contacted amazon to make a refund. even they agreed. still for past 5 days i haven't received any response from amazon, the faulty mobile is with me of No use.Very bad response from amazon.
  It supports only 2.4GHz wifi. If you are looking for faster internet speed then take a note on this, that this phone won’t support 5GHz wifi connectivity.Also noticed that the while having video call through WhatsApp, the call gets disconnected after a few minutes and then never gets connected.Sometimes it auto restarts.I am regretting on decision to buy this phone for my mom. My recommendation would be pay a bit higher but go for better brands.
  Amazing product 😊 thanks you
  I recieved mobile on 9th August 2021, when open the box unable to power on mobile. Same day I called to support they initiated replacement. Delivery boy came to my home at same day. He tried to power on mobile, as I already said this mobile is not powering on. He started argument without IMEI varification I will not give you the replacement. My question is here if mobile is dead then how and why he was insisting. Did customer care support team have raised proper request for replacement. Carrier guy cancel my replacement. I called again to customer care I explained everything and they said once replacement cancelled. We can only refund. I accepted that preposal as well. Same thing happened here again when carrier guy came to my home same question asked for IMEI varification I need to power on mobile.boss if phone is dead then how you will varify. This things happen almost 5 time. What I observed here customer care support team is not initiating my refund properly.I am prime member on Amazon but my experience is very very bad still I am struggling for refund.
  Very good product, nice looking,super
  I love this mobile redmi 9 its a beautiful mobile in law budgget.
  Good option after Realme Narzo 10A and C3
  Mobile ka battery backup or cemara bahut hi kharab h mene phone ko wapis karne k liye dekha to bolte h ki time nikal gya h 25 September ko mobile delivered hua or 26 ko time nikal gaya bol diya h i am very very sad 😭😭😭😭 but kuch kr nhi sakta hu price bhi 9500 le liya or ab kuch nhi kr sakte hai west of money and i don't like Amazon facility mene jab jab bhi kuch bhi itam magaya wo kuch na khuch problem nikalta h any timeThanks for Amazon
  2 problem No Type-C port and IR Blaster
  its just 7days, but stop working , very bad quality , amazon should check before selling this kid of product,yesterday was last day of repayment, i request for call me on amazon, i got call from [Subhojit], he took 28minutes on call but cant help me out, even he is not bother about, its not expected form them  i wanted to return but he didn't help me and due date is passed yesterday , some how i fill that they just wanted to pass the time so they time so my return date finish and they are in safe zone, other wise i never wait on call for so long, over all very bad experience with mobile as well as amazon, but one think is good that i didn't renew my amazon prime member ship, its west of money and time,
  Product is nice,battery life also good,apart from camera quality not apto the mark but overall value for money product....only issue is they not provide me tempered glass & back cover too along with handset...they should provide this 2 things together...overall fine...thanks😊💐👍
  phone is not value for moneyThe camera is worst i ever seen in any no redmi phone.Battery is ok.The display quality is very bad not hd. Watching videos on YouTube feels like watching 3gp videos.mobile display is ok in lookwise but not good in quality.Sometimes 4gb ram feels like 2gb.I am very disappointed by the camera quality of this phone.12 megapixel feels like 2MP camera. The back plastic body feels like a cheap phone.If you really need a phone there are many options in the market.If you are taking phone for the first and a beginner you can go for redmi 9 prime
  I went to service center for inspection the kept the phone for 2 day's for digonosis  at last chasing them out they told me that main bord of your phone got damaged due to water went inside the phone via finger print. But i haven't used phone in wet hand at all neither it went into water. Pathetic service experience ever faced in service center. Then i went for another option of open market where they took 2000/-  and my phone started working as usual where as service center manager refused to repair and told me the expense will come around 8000/- to replace display as well main bord of the phone. That to we will not take any assurance it will work. This is the condition of service. Very disappointed.
  Value for money product. The #Redmi9 is best mobile at this rate which comes 2.3ghz clock speed and 4GB ram. Very smooth and I liked the battery capacity very much. I can play pubg on it for continue 5 hours after full. So happy that I buyed this mobile. I love the #MI brand very much.#Redmi9_iz_lub
  Product is good but protection (back cover) not provided and not available in market for this model.Pl. Provide suitable simple back case for minium protection
  It is not C-type chager that's the first thing to fooling the customer and second one is every mi phone has  ir blaster but it doesn't having, I bought redmi8 it has both features and as it is old model and I bought it for @of ₹8000 Only but nNow it has 8799 by loosing the these features as I am get fool for the product I bought and Amazon also having the hand in it. It has to be take responsible for it
  Best Budget phone.Dear Customers please remember that the Price is always directly propotional to the quality.This low price model lacks Type C Charging port. There is no Type C port. Its the old pin.Sound quality is really worst.My sincere advice to spend 1000 more and go for Mi 9 Pro.
  Purchased this phone on 07/11/2021. Find below my reviews.Display: It is goodDesign: Ok (I feel it could be designed much better than current design)Finger print: Not facing any issuesBattery: FineCamera: Very poor. Most of the time the photo is blurred, especially photos taken in AI mode.Most of the people mentioned the camera is not good. I believe a 13mp camera is good for me but I never expected the camera quality to be this much worse.If you want to purchase a phone specifically for photography then I strongly recommend please go with some other phones.Reason behind why I chose Redmi is, Last Diwali I purchased a Samsung Galaxy 31 for 16,000 during the great Indian festival. But within a year there was an issue with the motherboard. So I don't want to put more pennies on my phone.
  Good phone in this price category.Pros -# screen size is good and can be use with 1 hand also.# look of the phone is good in compare to others phone of this category.# phone i haven't used much but 5000 mah battery would be good.Cons :-I have not found more but on the back side 2 camera are there and one camera is just dummy print.Suggestion :Better to go with 128 GB. Mine is 64GB only.
  I don't like the phone because it is not working in manner..It is self rebooting continually in every 10Seconds.Please mark this issue and start rectifying in further device production...Because your service centres are not being operated in service manner..Actually they just manipulate the all customer instead of resolving the issues..#Mi service centre , aggarwal plaza, mangalam palace, M2K sector-3 , Rohini , Delhi .
  1: Purchased for Father who is knew to the smartphone world operation and features and it served his purpose the very best in this range of INR 10K.2: Also in the mobile industry every thing changes so dynamically that sky rocket configurations and prices have no limits hence sticked to this fix budget of INR 10K and features to an extent to conclude the purchase.3: Orange Color is quiet charming and pleasant to opt as well.
  4GB RAM 64GB StorageColour: blackDONT BUY THIS MOBILE .Don’t buy this product .Image quality is below average comparing with the specification. Useless camera.And there is NO RETURN POLICY and replacing with same mobile is big headache .DON’T buy this mobile
  Fast Fingerprint reader, large and clear screen, huge battery, overall well built. I choose this for my girlfriend, she doesn't play heavy games, for that matter she doesn't play any games on smartphons, so the Helio G35 with 4gb ram and 64gb storage is more then enough for her Facebook insta, and the 6.57inch HD display is also great for her nonstop Netflix and other media consumptions. She actually needed a phone with big screen and finger print security. Plus good battery life and no lags. So redmi 9 was a great gift for her. I myself use Realme x2pro because I'm a heavy user so that super amoled fhd+ 90hz display is a sureshot nessesity for me and a phone with the Snapdragon 855+ processer was what I was looking for under 35k.  First I thought to buy her some similar phone but than I thought why? She don't need that much powerful phone, so I gave her exactly what she needed. Huge screen, huge battery, good camera decent processer, 4gb ram. For her multitasking and 64gb storage for all her photos songs and videos and yea it has option for expanding the memory too which my phone doesn't have so I have to stick to the 128gb only.
  Someone should give Nobel Prize for creating such a third class phone. If you put your phone idle for a few minutes SIM card is not getting detected. (Screenshots attached). So I became not reachable over phone. Now with a restart it again can detect both the SIM and joyfully if you give a call to someone from either of the dual SIMs on the other side over the phone none will hear any sound 🙄 now thinking if I had bought any feature phone atleast I can connect to people over a call. Now when bought , Amazon showed 7 days replacement but now waiting for some technician visit to confirm that this model has a manufacturing problem. So a strong No No for this product. Don't be trapped over the lesser price rather go for some pro Series of redmi if needed.
  I am so addicted to Amazon now that I don't even remember half my orders. They just come and I take them. It's that simple. This  product had a exchange option where i had to return my older phone. No problems. The entire process took 10 mins. The executive came took my phone check a few things and game me the new phone and left. Amazing !!
  My primary phone screen shattered and due to lockdown I'm unable to fix it.Ordered redmi 9 and Amazon delivered in  1day. A miracle! At these times.Great phone for the price, really happy with performance. Never heats up. Battery last 2 days with heavy use.Camera very very poor quality.So if buying for camera consider higher models.Highly impressed for the price.Go for it.
  If you pay peanuts you get monkeys - that's quite true for the Redmi 9. With good specs on paper available at the then low price of Rs 9000 I made a greed-fueled decision to go for this. After 3 months I find the glass has scratched all too easily (as opposed to my Lenovo smartphone), the MIUI OS is buggy as hell and the gyroscope just does not work so moving the phone around does not change the orientation in GPS maps (or games). Overall a pathetic device.
  I have purchased this and gifted. This is not a good phone where the quality and the performance is poor.Camera is poor.Charging slot is not type-C & not quick charge too, will have to wait approx 3 hours to complete the charge.Screen rotation is poor where it is taking 1-2 complete seconds to rotate the screen.Overall the quality and the performance of the phone is poor. I would recommend to not go with this phone.Atleast am allowed to write this comments in Amazon whereas if I would have purchased in mi.com, they'll block my comments and will not post if I give a rating less-than 4.
  Its a great phone but don't buy Acko insurance with it as theyvare fraud.I bought the insurance with the phone, I got a message from Acko to register and I did. I saw the insurance being activated on my number and the device but the very next day without any reason they cancelled it themselves . Then it was a fight between them and Amazon. Amazon suggest to buy the insurance again which I did and again Acko denied it as it was not bought with the phone. I just feel its a fraud going on, they generate interest with insurance with phone and later cheat like this. DONT BUT ACKO insurance
  Dear teams, This is to inform you that I have purchased Redmi 9 (Sky Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)| 5000 mAh| 2.3GHz Mediatek Helio G35 Octa core  as per the our friend request, but this phone camera is very very poor quality front and back also, and main important when we can attend the meeting on Zoom or webx after 5 minutes showing on screen  CPU is too high uses please close the APP.. our main motive purchase this phone for online class for Daughter.. but over all very very poor performance. we will definitely returns the product but after purchase i was sick, so then 10 day over other wise we will never keep this phone. now we are helpless for returns the product..ThanksShashikant
  Redmi 9 (4GB RAM + 64GB Storage) Delivered by Amazon on 4th Aug, first two week worked properly.But after that started facing below 2 issues.1. This mobile is unable to detect any SIM, tried with factory reset too.2. Also noticed that volume bar popping up on screen automatically and unable to increase the Mobile volume by using button, this issue got disappeared for some time after rebooting the mobile but that reboot button is also not functioning sometime, need to press that button multiple time to get the reboot / power off option screen on mobile.
  Inspite being a nice phone in budget, this phone has issues:1. Doesn't support split screen2. Doesn't support 5ghz wireless frequency3. You can't use this phone as a remote control for devices that are not wifi enabled (IR devices)4. If you use this phone as a mobile hotspot, you can't view devices connected to your hotspot5. You can't get one-handed modeThese are features that you will find in Mi phones even in a lower range.
  Writing the review after 3 months of usage.1. Look and fell of the product is good.2. Fingerprint sensor is bit laggy.  Sometimes it didn't read the fingerprints.3. Performance is ok, Can't say it's too slow. But if you want fast performance than go for something else.4. Camera quality is ok. Not too good but not to bad.5. Battery life is good.I bought it for my mom and it serve the purpose.If you want to use all the capabilities of smart phone please look for something else.
  Good look phone with 5000mh battery, but camera quality too disappointing. No IR blaster, No C type port. I had purchased redmi 9 (4/64) by exchanging Redmiy3 (3/32) . But actulalky redmi y3 is far better then redmi9. I desire to return it. If any one want to purchase redmi phone then go for redmi 9 prime and avoid to buy redmi9
  Bought in october 2020. One day delivery from amazon, great as always. Using the device since then, so here is the detailed review of redmi 9.- Built quality is good overall. Feels a midrange smartphone and a bit bulky in hand, due to plastic back. But other than that, phone is built decent.- Processor stack (Helio G35) is mediocre, to get the job done. Provides adequate performance, nothing too fancy there.- Having a battery of 5000 mAh, it lasts roughly around whole day while performing day to day activities like streaming, browsing and downloading. Never tested games on it. So, performance might differ in that case. While charging device heats up significantly, while taking from 0% it took 5 hours to make it 100% as its bundled with 10W slow charger.- The IPS HD+ display is doing well, I haven't got any issues regarding color accuracy, saturation or viewing angles as of now.- Speakers are decent, not that great. Call quality and cellular reception is good, on par with the other alternatives.- All Mi phones has the same issues in software part as this one also having MIUI, packed with a lot of bloatware and stuff. Security patches are updated regularly, but the overall update cycles are indefinite and after an update some features just stops working randomly. After OTA update, phone dropped signal, kept restarting, keyboard is not appeared when focused on an inputbox, etc etc. Overall an laggy android experience.- Camera is really disappointing. Not good at all, the daylight images are bad, HDR is not working properly. Images taken in night are even worse.These are the things I have found during 5 months of usage. Thanks
  Let's start with the pros:A really good battery. Easily runs for an entire day in higher than average use. Lightweight, Sleek, Has smooth fingerprint sensor, loud and has a really good processor if you're a game lover. The photos despite twin cam setup are good and only get grainy in low light. Use pro-mode if you want the best output.Cons:No type C charge or Fast Charge Support. Could have been better had there been tri cam setup like Poco C3 (it lacks FingerPrint Sensor though). Non Stock Android is a turn off as phones like Moto G10 Power and many other have either Stock Android or lesser bloatwares while MIUI is notorious with its UI.Summary: Go for it if you're MIUI user as it will feel very homely. Also, if you are a game lover an want something under 10K, this is one of the options you should go for. Don't opt for it if you're hardcore into photography.7.5/10
  Reviewing on behalf of my customer-I have purchased it for selling in my shop name happymind.I sold to one of my customer and after a month of use he gcame to my shop and given following feedback-He said i have given him a very good product that meets his demands like he is able to work his daily routine work on phone , and the battery back is long lasting.Sound quality is also very good.Design is also very good.Camera quality is very good in this price range phones.It worth buying product.

  Dont purchase products from this seller,all the products are defective.First time when i ordered memory card slot was not working and second time when i applied for exchange they had again given damage phone,this time there was some error in display and sometimes phone gets automatically switched off, suffered a lot at last i had to refund the phone and purchase from somewhere else.Very bad experience this time,its my request to amazon to please look over it and ensure the quality of products.
  I bought this for my nani quality is great even i tried some gsmes like wcc3 abd wcc2 it handels perfectly but at low setting, according to price mobile is awesome battery backup in 6 - 8 days if only use for calling and if you are multitasker then easily last for 1-1.5 day on heavy to moderate use, now coming to camera the camera is not ss great but i got this for 8000 it worth every penny i spend you can't accept a flagship level camera at this price, if you are a camera lover just don't buy but if you want big storage big battery abd classy looks and a trusted brand just go for it you will not regret at your decision. Handels multitasking easily but not a gaming processor, you can use 10 apps wp, fb, YouTube and all without any lag issue. Phone doesn't heat that's good. Great quality mobile at affordable price thanku MI. And  Amazon
  Bad mobilemy suggestion for everyone who is thinking to buy redmi 9, please don't buy.Redmi is a very trust brand but not redmi 9.I purchased this phone 3weeks ago, first it was in good condition, after 3 weeks it started to hang every morning, after 4 days the phone completely shutdown.I don't know what to do, before getting one month this happened.It's getting really hurt to use this phone.
  Phone hangs so many times, switch off while using. watching video on YouTube, incoming call doesn't show but ringtone plays, camera quality average, phone performance is below average, battery performance is fine, Amazon services is poor, sends technician, he hard reset the phone then he checks it for 4 or 5 minutes and say it is ok, what if it's performance if you have to hard reset it 2 time during 7 days, because after hard reset every phone works perfectly for some times while technician checks it for 5 to 10 minutes. Very bad experience with Amazon services and xiaomi product this time.
  Specification good enoughBought for attending online classes and it is very smooth. Have tried streaming videos, MS office files and I have not seen any lags.Not much of a gamer so haven't utilized 100% of HW.Charging time is about 3 hours and lasts more than a day.Camera quality average.1 major concern for me is the display when the phone is operated outdoor. The brightness level is so low we can barely see anything under the sun light
  Very bad experience in that mobile I purchased.. the mobile camera clearity is not good and veryvery poor quality
  Sir,  I ordered this on 5/10/2020. Received on 9 th october. Yiu were mentikned 5000mah bateert but it was taking to much if time to charging abd not diwnload the video with in 1/2 an hour. Photo were not quality very poor photos.I put on charger yesterday night 9 pm with 49%. Today morning at 7 pm it wad completed 71%.
  Review after five months usageHa it is ok type not that good or best oneIf you play games not preferred but for normal users might be goodBatter life ok 6-8 hoursCharging time 1 hourCamera front came not goodBack came ok typeIt hangs and sticks sometimesIf you play pugb sure it won't last long
  Just in  one sentence..Those who are interested in buying a good camara phone, don't go for it.. it disappoints you ..It may attract you only with respect to it's 4GB RAM and 64GB memory and the 4 camaras is just to draw your attention at this price range of around 9000 but I strongly recommend you to spend a little more amount on some other models by going through their genuine reviews..👍👍
  The phone is of 6.53 inches and it's so big. The camera quality is also nice.When I ordered the phone I was checking people's review some was saying it's bad, some was saying it's camera is not good and some were saying it's awesome and much etc but then I decided to order it when the phone reached to me I checked it, like always amazon gives you the best. Overall I wanna say about the phone is you should buy it, it's so good❤️🙏👍 #loveit
  It is the best phone at 8999
  The product is good to use, but giving 1 star because I can't use it to call anymore the speakers are too low to hear other persons voice..Not recommended..Bought 4 pieces for the staff all of them have similar issues.Maybe I should have to stick to a good brand.

  Purchased this around may end and got it delivered by June 1st week 2021 and I am writing this review on 2nd September 2021. So basically I have used this for 3 months. I am not someone who uses phone for gaming or prolong use. I use it just for calls, message,mails, WhatsApp and payment. That's it. Not even fb, insta, Netflix, prime, nothing. So I have basic uses. Still this phone started showing problems in less than 3 months. Problems that the phone showed in less than 3 months:1) It has started slowing down2) the charger wire has loosened up and I had to use a spare one which I had3) the phone is so heavy that when you hold your phone in your hand for long calls like 30 mins call without using earphone, or if you chat for some 15-20 mins, your wrist will hurt, I got carpal tunnel syndrome by using this just for 3 months and planning to get a minor surgery soon. It's weight is more than one plus series phones.4) the worst camera quality I have ever seen.One can think to buy this for urgent use or for very short term use. I had to buy this when my samsung phone got into a drain and I really needed one asap and during May month all shops were closed for 2nd wave of covid. This phone will definitely show some issue withing few months even if u r a moderate user, not using much social media and not palying any games.
  Writing Review after 1 month use:Over all mobile is quite good in this price range but camera quality is very poor.I would suggest don't buy this phone, go with Redmi 9 Note.Poor camera quality.Bettery life is very good.MIUI 12 (Android 10) is very good. Smooth performance, don't hang with normal usage.Screen quality is good.Finger sensor is very quick.Amazon's 7 day replacement policy is very poor. If your phone has really any defact then only it will get replaced with same model. You can't return & buy another better model.
  Read the Complete Review for better understanding.I bought this phone for my father (moderate level usage). Majority of his consumption is Whatsapp, Online banking, UPI, and Emails (No Games or Videos/Movies at all). He has been using this phone for 3 months now.Pros:1. Good Display (8/10)2. Battery is fine (6/10) Bcoz the phone is not used for gaming or watching videos, the battery lasts for 2 days easily3. Fingerprint Sensor works fine (6/10) Hit and Miss, Sometimes works and Sometimes doesn't.4. Audio is great (8/10)Cons:1. Bad Camera (3/10) Both, The Rear and the Selfie cameras are very low res. Other than just basic photo taking, You can't do anything.2. 4gb Ram is a lie- After you start using the device you won't believe it has 4gb ram, the phone is very slow. If you'll open more than 3 apps, the phone will start to hang and i am not talking gaming, just simple appsFinal Verdict- In the Description, it may look like you are getting good specs at this price but it is not the same in hand. Forget long term usage, You will be fed up of this after max. 1 year.Advice: Put in some extra thousands and buy a better phone

   First worst experience with amazon while purchasing mobile. There is a small creamish spot inside the screen, could be manufacturing defect or could be the result of improper handling. Even after replacement I got a defective piece again with screen tint issue on the left side of the camera. Video posted. Dropped Amazon and went to Flipkart now.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   The camera quality is absolutely worse. Me and my family members have been using redmi mobiles and all of mobiles have a great camera quality. This was the reason and trust I ordered one more redmi mobile for my younger brother but I'm surprised with the camera quality. it's very bad and guys don't buy this mobile if you're looking for a good camera in the mobile. There are other mobiles available in redmi and other company which is more worthy. I'll attach some pictures so that you guys can aware of this before buying.
  At this price range if you want to buy a mobile for your online class and for your children then I will recommend this product. If you want to buy this mobile for other purposes then I will recommend to don't buy it.And don't go to the youtube review . Really it too different after I buy I knew very well.So it is your choice what you di.
  I bought it for my mother, and she is learning to use it. 4GB/64GB at this price is really good. Touch is very responsive and quick. Screen quality is little dull and sound output is low compared to other Redmi phones. Redmi needs to work on these for budget phones. Camera is average as it is not camera centered phone. Network reception and battery power is good, last for 1.5 days with normal usage. Overall good phone for beginners and elderly people to start with
  Display better for this price but if you can spend a 1000 rupees more go for Redmi 9 Prime which has better FHD display and good processor than this.  Function is good especially for online classes and also the size of display is good for online classes. Games mild okay.  Camera is really bad in even very light conditions.  Good only in bright places and close-up shots. Overall 3.5 out of 5.
  To start of with mobile has medicore camera with a quality of mobiles in 2010s. Even with 4gb ram it hangs a lot which will definitely frustrate you a lot. Battery backup is poor and the charger isn't type C. It takes around 4hours to charge fully.PS: I bought this phone for my dad and he only takes call and uses WhatsApp. To my surprise he himself wasn't happy with this mobile due to its poor performance and the screen which is LCD which cannot play HD videos. Colours in video isn't punchy and can make look a red colour a orange colour.I have asked Amazon and they have replaced with a new unit and the customer care representative is completely supportive. Can't blame them for the products efficiency.
  It's been three days now. My readmi 9 phone is performing well. I like the blue shade back cover, the camera picture quality is good, much better than my previous phone. Battery lasts for a day after full charge. I watch a lot of videos on Instagram and youtube and I make a lot of calls. Battery lasts for one day with all this usage. Finger is my favourite. I can unlock the phone with a simple touch.
  Redmi 9... Other than MIUI 12.0.5, 4GBRAM &64GB this phone is very ordinary. The CAMERA is worst compared to older phones frm XIAOMI..NO LED LIGHT FOR NOTIFICATIONS...overall nothing impressive in this phone.. Quite disappointed.ADDING one PROS abt the phone:Sound quality is good.Battery life good.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   Overheating within 15-20 mins of usage.Screen flickering on auto brightness. Also flickering if brightness is kept below 50%.One of the worst phones I've used till date.
  Camera is good & the battery backup is strong & at this cost that is amazing phone
  I am using this since phone since a week, completely a good experience and and camera got its best potential, best display, battery, and speakers, value  for money. #redmi9 best mobile , overall best mobile.
  Absolutely not happy with this phone because it's not even 2 months buying I am facing issues like there is no gyroscope no high resolutions and now I am connected with a Bluetooth headphones there is no sound and there is no sound in wired headphones so if Xiaomi people are reading this comment then jaake apni maa chudao and others also pls read this hope this helps you and this happens after the update came
  I bought this product based on my past experience with Redmi note 5 which was really Good. This time I got disappointed after purchasing this product. Everything was going fine for the first 3-4 days but all of sudden my phone get starting auto restart at the interval of less than a minutes. I am not able to use my phone from yesterday since it is auto restart as soon as I unlock it. Not satisfied with this product at all.
  I bet a Redmi series of phone doesn't need reviews. It's always the best for budget. Only pros is lagging after a while due to more bug fix updates and usage of more apps. Otherwise Redmi rockzzz
  I like this phone.But, I have trouble with the automatic settings regarding battery saving. If the mobile screen is off, whatsapp gets offline. But I need it always online as I am using whatsapp web on my computer always irrespective of whether I use my mobile or not.If the system shows that whatsapp is using battery that simply means that it is in use. So, the basic idea should be to continue to provide what is in use rather than to stop it. After all, I bought it to use and not to waste my time in going through all the available settings in the system.
  After using for few days this are the pros and cons i will mentionPROS1) 5000 mAh Battery.2) Performance for Normal usage is Impressive.3) Supports 20W fast charging.4) Perfect phone for people looking for  Budgeted phone.5) Good for playing low resolution games.CONS1) The Rear Camera is not so good.2) The Front Camera as well is not good.3) Design of this phone is Just Ok, not so well  plastic body Comes with 10W slow charger,  although supports 20W Fast charging.4) Not good for high resolution gaming as it has  outdated processor.
  I am using this mobile on 6th marchFrom starting date to till now mbl will be overheating and sometimes hanging and another thing is sometimes touch will not workingThat's why I return this productI need refund but your claint will told I will give you the replacement.This time also same product will happen amazon people will make a refundAnd one more thing is camera quality also not goodDon't dissapoint with my feedback because this problem is happend.
  Very good features for a budget phone. Acceptable performance and for its huge battery surprisingly is light weight. Full day usage sees only 50% of battery left. Screen resolution is so smooth. Highly recommended.
  Excellent phone for price below 9k. Exchanged my old phone so got it for even lower price. Bought it for mom and perfect for her use.Pros:1. Large screen2. Good sound3. Blue colour looks good4. Does daily tasks like calling, youtube, gpay with ease5. Good battery6. Overall good experience7. Speaker is loud tooCons:1. Very average camera. Daylight condition is fine. In night, camera quality can suffer.Overall still good phone and worth buying. If camera is specifically needed then try something else.
  i like the camera it is good ,the screen is also good but i feel that the bezels are somewhat big but the overall form factor is good but the only thing that i am not sure with is the processor as it is a mediatek processor but it works fine it would have been nice if they have given fast charging option  but for the price it is well rounded so if you are looking for a good phone under 10k go for it

   Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain "cool" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps
  Genuine product.Loved this phone... actually bought for my mom on her birthday she loved it.. 💙Made in India and has no ban apps pre-installed that's impressive.Overall worth buying. Totally budget phone with good configuration.Ordered on last night got the delivery early morning 8am that was so fast very impressive.
  Very bad experience with this phone1)Camera below avg2)Charger Not working within 2months of purchase of mobile. and also there customer service center not replace tha charger they just make any excuse to not provide you warranty replacement of products3) when you playing game and getting calls most of the time hang or screen get blackout4) Most of the time Dual sim network not work properly. When someone calling you thay said outoff network or switch off. while phone is still on5) i really feel bad to choose this mobile. I generally don't write review but after this kinds of experience i just thought to write a review to help someone to not choose this mobile
  You CANT connect to 5Ghz wifi! Their website info is misleading. It's not dual band! I am now stuck with 2 mobiles with hardly any speed to access net while I have a blazing Airtel Internet connection at home!The whole phone is sluggish.Battery is very good!Camera also is kool.But overall a worst choice for extensive users of wifi! That's it.
  Battery life is all fine ...If you aren't a heavy gamer u can rely on ur fully charged phone for the whole day longFingerprint reader is very appropriate , untill you get your fingers wetCamera quality is quite average ...But you get the slow motion mode for videos which is quite finePerformance is slightly above average ...You can play 7 to 8 hours of gameBut the heating problem exists...And I personally hate it ...I don't know why they aren't working on it ..You could burn your body hairs with the heated back surface of the phone .Display is okay ...You won't complainOver-all at this budget range this is probably just best phone ...Go for it without a thought if your budget is tight ...You won't get something better
  After 15days of use, it starts hung up, I have used Redmi earlier also but this is worst, I have bought it on exchange, is this new handset or renewed set, I don't know but after 15days of use and only 23gb using out of 128gb, it hang up. Very slow response of screen. My old mobile Redmi 4 was  far better then this which I have exchanged. Redmi india what shall I do. 03/11/21- i have updated miui, now seems ok,  no hanging issue
  The overall performance of the phone is very good but the camera is not very much when compared to other phones pixel rate is I don't know it's not good also. the alarm option alarm  it is not at all making any sound. When you set an alarm it is very hard to hear the alarm sound
  I got this phone in deal in Amazon shopping festival hence was able to encash the opportunity to buy it. What could be better at budget range with 6 gb of memory and 64 gb of storage space. Camera is good but not for people who love to click selfies and more. Best deal for my uncle and he was happy with phone. What could be best to make some one smile. Thank you Amazon
  A simple smartphone. Don't get too much hyped for the features being provided in this budget.Its a normal smartphone with regular qualities.Pros-1. Large Screen size2. Loud Speaker3. Battery LifeCons-1. Lags from the first unpacking in setting up the phone.2. Not a user-friendly interface. A first user will face a lot of difficulties while using.3. Camera doesn't justifies the quality and mps.4. Fingerprint scanner can be stubborn.
  For simple usage of calls, watsap and video calls, the phone is very good but not made for extensive use like playing heavy gamesThe camera quality is not so much good but it's satisfactory.All other features are good. Overall it's a nice phone
  Does not feel like a phone released in sept 2021. Features and phone is exactly like redmi phones 2 years ago....nothing special except better more ram and storage in the price range.No earphones provided and the FM radio still requires headphone as antenna.Battery us 5000mA but it still last 24hrs only. 2years ago 3000mA also lasted 24hrs so bigger battery no big deal.
  specifications are ok but poor cameraboth cameras are not so gooddisplay brightness is low in dat lightperformance is ok
  Mobile looks bit okay, not too good. But yes redmi will overtake other brands in this price range, that's why redmi rockzzzz. But camera is very poor, if you are a selfie & photo crazy person I won't recommend this. For a normal person who needs battery & other benefits this is better mobile.Pros : Stylish look  User friendly  Battery stand upCons : Poor Camera  Bit bulky in hand  Bit overweight.Overall in 10 K this mobile I rate 6/10. Much better than other mobiles. kinda okay👌.
  Worst product.When we are in conference call getting lot of disturbance. When i filed a complaint.one of the home technician called me and telling me that with out checking the mobile and with out coming to the home. He made a call directly and asking what is the problem and i have explained it. He told ok sir if customer care calls to you tell i have came to the home, with out visiting my house he is telling like that. And he told iam keeping order for new mobile in place of old. But when I contacted CS team they hva etold me there no new order placed on your number. And i was shocked. And technician wrote report as all is good. Now what i have to do?
  Awsome smartphone. The display is good, facelock,fingerprint, are good. Has lots of features in one and functions very fast and well. Another thing camera is also good but not so much as of Samsung. Most important in this budget you are getting 4GB Ram and 64GB storage that is the best. Lots of important pre installed apps/wallpapers. Good display. Battery not found so good. You can buy it freely if you are not a heavy phone addictor. Will have good result.
  I buy this mobile on but there is hitting chargger an mobile both .so I call Amazon customer service there is one executive he told me some software check an update but I don't try because of I buy new phone then why should I try ............that's time executive speak his supiror an told me pls pack this mobile I arrange new pack pic return.Thanks to Amazon return my mobile an give me another mobile within 3 working day's I m very happy my mobile I recieved an check all is working properly.Once again thank executive I forgot that's name but thanks a lots ........I m sure next time any product buy I m going on Amazon ..........
  Too much pre installed apps that never can be uninstalled,so taking many spaces,,,its front and back camera low quality, charging cable is not C type,its the pin type old usb cable, overall I am giving 3* as per my experience,also notable that colour of mobile what i ordered 80 % different
  It's a cool phone with an awesome look with good battery life and an average camera. Thought it would be heavy and difficult to handle... But once I held it in my hand it was very lightweight and slim.. overall great phone to buy in such an amazing price!
  I am writing this review after a month use.1. Camera is difficult to operate as in case of point & shoot the image captured is not clear. Even low priced old phones score better on this count.2. While searching names, most of the time the names do not show in drop down menu/method, which is irritating.3.The Mi music player do not operate as no songs feature  in it.Even on searching the playlist show as empty. Till now i am unable to play it.4.Battery life is just OK5.Overall I am unsatisfied from this phone, I had a big reputation about Redmi phones ,but this Redmi 9 is, failure. Redmi 8 is better, which also I am using, although it is older verdion.
  I feel AMAZON shopping a very happy and experience about my buy new MI redmi mobile at low weight,speed processor low price,more futures have. Totally satisfied a mobile use. Battery back up status is well and expected.my family is lucky at this mobile buying.once thanks to AMAZON great job.
  The phone is working fine but not having IR device to operate as TV control as I am doing for earlier amazon redmi3 & Y or Redmi 8 note phones. Else performance wise phone is good.The body of the phone is definitely not like note phones but sounds good.
  Very Good phone at these price range.  In 64 Gb Its already system used 12 Gb.  Camera quality poor, Its saying 13 Mega pixel,  I don't think so, it maybe 5 Mega pixel.  Once I cancel my prime membership,  delivery was delay.  Thanks Amazon. Now redmi coming made in india sticker
  I bought this phone for my daughter and she's happy to get it. She got online classes and she's happy to get a nice phone. She's not able to control her excitement as she didn't expect the good phone, she also play games on it and it's as per the needs.
  In, terms of speed ,memory and ease of use, it's good. Battery and fingerprint reading are excellent. But when, it comes to the speaker output with, certain, well known apps such as zoom, it's not good. Also the recorded voice does not have a reasonably good volume when played back.
  Phone is good in segment, i love the display its very clear and detailing.Battery back up is super, goor performance, built quality finishing etc are excellent, on the part of camera iam very disappointed cz redmi need to improve the clarity of camera considering the other company in this segment. Just ok thats all about camera. Otherwise its a nice pack and value for money
  Best phone to buy at this rate.My ratingsFront Camera 7/10Rear Camera 8/10Fingerprint 10/10Display 9/10 (-1 for low 1080p resolution)Design 10/10Facelock 10/10 (also detect in dark)Size 10/10Weight 9/10 (195gm not easy to handle)
  Bought this phone for my parents. They don't play games nor spend hours on social media, the battery life for the elders is awesome. For their usage (mostly watching youtube, whatsapp, zoom calls, MS teams, and other common applications) this has been a good gadget. With 126GB internal memory, this phone is not going to indicate memory low even if they receive 100s of social media forwards and voice notes. The mobile came with unwanted apps, which I deleted while setting up. Very happy with the clarity of text and the font size. Apps don't appear to be cluttered and notifications are displayed clearly. Overall happy with this mobile.
  I use dis cell for calling, txtin, 8ball pool. Cell is awesome. Smooth ui. Wat amazon really amazed me was tat the manufacturing date was 10/2020.i ordered 16 of Oct. Phone is perfect. I Don game n take pics. Dis is a grt budget mob. Ty amazon. (for the  grt xchange offer) RAGHAV HAPPY 😁🎉
  They don't provide screen guard, cover and IR sensorCamera quality is also not upto markAlso don't provide type C data cable for charging and data transferRest all good till now
  If you need a phone under 10K with decent features then this is the phone ..
  I am going to write review about my redmi 9 phone, i bought this phone 2nd time. I truly satisfied with its price range  for like this featurestic phone.Battery is working whole day for my need.Phone 's body is rough and tough.Camera is actually averaged not super.Fingerprint is works smoothly.And last, screen of the phone is working as like as other redmi phones.Phone never hang.It's speed is also better.
  Why do these mobile companies launch different model with same names? To lure someone into buying inferior product with superior name? The Redmi 9 available in India has far less features than the Redmi 9 available outside. Its a different model itself.I paid ₹1000 more for this. No Compass, poor display and camera and battery life is far less than my previous Moto phone with 5000 mAh battery. I should have enquired more. The compass was the main reason I went for this model. Now all festival offers are gone.
  I have been using Redmi phones for 4 years now. Used multiple phones & found this one with worst camera. Had used Redmi 4 before, it was just 8 MP camera but takes very beautiful photos. But this one is very disappointed for the price. Other than camera, everything else is goodIf you are not interested in Camera, you can go for it
  OsmAmazing experienceAll in oneMind blowing phoneSpecial thanks to mr manu jainCo-founder miLot of thanks
  Bought this phone for my father.... He has minimal usage and he doesn't need more multi tasking. He is content with big screen, triple camera and sound quality.So people who need performance shouldn't consider this phone... Better go for Snapdragon processor.The camera quality is average... What else you can get at this price range.. The sound quality is amazing... It's loud and clear.The fingerprint reader is aso amazing....it's fast and responsive.The battery life is also good considering average usage...Works for one and half day.
  if u want best features search another model instead if buy Redmi 9Activ.Here is my rating after 1month uses.👉Ram Good👉Storage Good👉Camera Average👉FingerPrint Good👉Disply Touch Average👉Battery Backup Good
  I always used to feel that spending more than 10k on a mobile is waste for people who uses his mobile  for a small period of time, iam the person who uses his phone hardly for 2 hrs a day, I used it for 4 days in a single charge I felt very great.
  Whatsup call and connectivity  Camera.Third class Phone  Connectivity very poor . Whatsup call not possible . Earlier Vivo Y 10 was incredible . Wasted money  Feeling sorry . This was a gift to my mother to have whatsup calls .After seeing so much Hype from Redmi I was carried away on this . I would have gone to Vivo . Redmi should improve the connectivity to get good response
  I have purchased couple of phones of Redmi, but This is the worst phone I have ever got, unfortunately didn't look it's functionality earlier otherwise I would have returned it on same day.Don't pay attention to paid review or the people who never used the good phones.If possible please do get some better phone instead of this.
  Ok is goodI give a presentation to my wifeI know very well for the six months for 8 month mobile will work 100% good after it will know what is a problem coming this is my experience in my life this is the seventh mobile I buy in my lifetimeAnyway thanks for the teamworkI hope all teamwork people with good health without coronavirus god bless everyone
  Beware.. Don't just look at the cost.This mobile does not have gyroscope sensor. So you cannot view VR (virtual reality) Google VR app is not compatinle with this mobile.Also there is no infrared so you cannot use the MI remote to operate TV, SET TOPBOX Or Your AC.
  I was worried by seeing the negative reviews. But then I purchased it and now I am happy. It's a good mobile. Overall it's performance is upto the level as per the price. Some people are expecting it to run as high priced phones having lots of more features. It's overall good.
  1 month review. Easy to use phone even for elderly after shifting from Samsung smartphone. Camera is sharper than Redmi 6 and focuses better too. Battery lasts for 3+ days with minimal internet usage. Sound quality is good.
  Worst phone.....camera quality is like VGA camera both front and rear camera. Voice during call is not audible even speakers are not good.Really total waste of money. I would never recommend this phone to anyone. If anyone is about to buy this phone then  please do some research from your side before purchasing this phone because it's performace specially in camera quality next call sound is far far below average.Please do not 🚫 buy this phone.A big NO for this phone.
  Worst👎 mobile phone📱 of Xaiomi I had ever seen. First bad experience with Xaiomi. Just on second day of unboxing phone getting hang. Battery🔋 back up is worst even after 5000 mAh, back up is not enough for one day. I think this is duplicate mobile phone of Xaiomi. I want to replace with Redmi 9 prime.
  I usually buy phones directly from the Xiomi store.Never ever had any UI or app not loading issue with my older devices with just 3GB of RAM.Have recently purchased this phone on Amazon. It doesn't feel like using 4GB for the same usage.  When the UI will be stuck you don't know. Having worst experience. Not sure of the root cause.
  Am writing this review after 6days of purchase, really this phone is not at all worth the money we give, especially the camera clarity it's just like a basic keypayd mobile like camera, I had redmi 8a with me which was 100% better than this mobile which I exchanged for this mobile. The battery life is also not so good.. Overall just a smartphone for those who never take photos and less usage... Pls think before buying.
  At first, my dad was happy with the phone with all the basic smartphone features until the Network issues started.The Wifi Calling doesn't work even though it's working from my other Samsung phone over same Wifi and Mobile Operator.When Wifi-calling was switched off, calls went through but Without ANY Rings. This is clearly a product fault.Not even 2 days, I have put Screen Protector, will you send me New screen protector too with phone replacement?
  Not from hardcore gaming - but play you can play pubg/bgmi only if u r fan, all thing as mentioned,dual camera but quality is not that much goodaverage gaming performanceoverall buy this if your for daily use and movies multimedia becz of big screenlook is awesome and for light gaming 1-2 hours
  Hi order this phone via amazon by exchange offer,  I tried the same with flipkart but  they rejected the phone  which was working fine.  Thanks amazon for accepting the old phone.A big thumbs-up to amazon
  It is just okay type of phone, camera and sound quality is not good, any old 5k phone will give you better picture. Bettery life is good.
  It is very bad please don't buy it. When I oder this I got a used product . It have no modern functions.Split screen is also removed. camera is very Bad . I suggest you if your budget is 8,000 to 9,000 you should buy Redmi 8a dual with 8mp camera which is better than this.And if budget is 9,999 you should buy Redmi 9 prime. Overall it's depends on you.
  Redmi 9 is a phone which is quite justified seeing it's price. It has an amazing battery. The storage is more than enough at this price but somehow the camera quality lacks in places that somehow makes you wonder or regret of only I could have gone for Redmi 9 Prime. Anyways. It's a great phone to use. It comes with a 10W charger which takes time but for me it's a plus point cause for my previous phones, I didn't get a charger.
  Best budget mobile under 9000/-Better to go with Redmi 9 Prime
  Camera quality not great compared to Oppo.... I don't recommend buying this phone. It gets heated up too soon and sometimes screen gets frozen or keeps flickering...
  Obviously, Good Battery is a plus. If someone markets this phone for Fast finger reader is Nonsense.  Can't you afford a few milliseconds extra.The manufacturer has taken granted your phone for posting Ads as they wish at your cost.  This is ridiculous.If you are looking for your own phone, this is not a good choice.
  The fingerprint sensor, and the battery power are good features of this phone. Picture quality with the different cameras are just okay. The phone is working smoothly even with additional installation of other apps.
  Phone has auto restart problem it's been 20 days and in 1 hour it almost restart 38 times and it appears after ur return replacement date over..... Disappontted plus the brightness is very very low.... Quality is not as expected
  This phone delivered on 4th November 2020 with in 1 month (1st December) it got complained. From the beginning itself charging was too slow and phone getting heat also,but I didn't mind that only because this was common for redmi phones . But On Dec 4th when it had 70 above percentage charge suddenly it got switched off, then I tried to switch on but didn't  works so, I tried charge the phone then that's not worked. At-last I charged by other phone charger and got charged. After the use of 10 minute I noticed that charge was getting reduced.
  Mobile is okay but Camera is a crap, no headset and no back cover with this mobile also this is not a fast charging mobileRest all is fine runs smoothly.
  I wish I had seen the reviews before purchasing this phone. The front camera is so horrible that I'm wondering if their so called specification of ai enabled selfie camera is even true. Would not recommend this phone to anyone. So disappointed
  Works good. Smooth. But if you have all the social media apps then it may lag a bit. Dont try heavy games. Battery is concerning when all these social apps are in the phone. Camera is ok. Finger print reader is fast
  It's been 4 months I have been using this phone... Camera quality bad n the phone is getting hanged many times... After long time a got phone which is not worth it.. The touch pad is not good as well... Plz don't go fr it... Even if u have any emergency try some other one not this one
  Not good phone. Some time found error in all apps and data connection lost automatically after reset defult work properly..WIFI CONNECTIVITY IS SO POOR.I have also vivo y81 phone above 3 year old  and purchase a redmi 9 but when i connect my vivo ph with my TV work properly.and when i connect my phone REDMI 9 WITH MY TV some time cant connect and if connect succesfully after 1 min movie not show fluently..DONT PURCHASE REDMI 9.I FEEL BETTER WITH MY OLD VIVO Y81 BETTER THEN REDMI 9.
  By buying this product i am very happy ist battery life is more than 20hour and it never warm i play 2 hour continued game but it is not warm it is more batter than other products in this range
  I have upgraded from redmi 5 to this, in design compared to redmi 5 this is not that good. Bettery is good, big dispaly but not bright as redmi 5, performance is ok. Cameras are ok for the price range. Good for online classes for my kid, but not a worthy upgrade to redmi 5.
  after buy redmi 9 I was not satisfied with quality and functioning of product I complain to replacement, company replaced it, this handset also defective and due to facing dengue in my family members so I was not used the handset and go to hospital for treatment. after which date was closed for return and refund status this product performance is very bad we have seen two product of same model both are not run properly and its models are defective if possible please help to us to change / refund .
  Worst quality phone. Fall from 3ft hight only and screen broken. I think no Garilla glass here. Heating issue on average use. When I use screen recorder to record something from browser selecting system sound option , it's can't record it.
  It's ok. but not upto the mark.camera is not good, battery life is good.speed is ok
  I purchased this phone in Oct 2020 and after using 9 months very smoothly, it accidentally fell and screen damaged completely. We had taken Acko General Insurance so we contacted them and they picked device from home, replaced with new screen and delivered to home !!! This mobile and it's insurance both are truly value for money.
  First of all I must thank Amazon for delivering the phone in less than 24 hours. The exchange was hassle free.I have been using Redmi phones since 5 years.  The features present in Redmi 9 are not available at this low price. If you want a all rounder with a limited budget go for it.
  Dear All,This is very unfortunate to tell you about this product and Amazon.in that they have promised an extra cash back of Rs 500/- on this product whereas when this product got delivered, there was no cashback given to us. Hence it can be concluded that whatsoever amazon says it does not do and what they do they never say. In my case the product tag line is mentioned as extra cash back of Rs. 500/- whereas the Amazon.in has failed to provide the cashback to us.
  Bought this phone for my mom and she uses it quite a lot. She says the battery life is superb but other than that it's an okay device to use. Camera is not good, so is the UI. Has an issue of hanging/freezing frequently.
  if your phone is slighty chipped on the corners they void entire warranty and charge you additional service charge of 118 rupees even when you have warranty just to  have a look. worst phone to buy not a common man phone anymore.. worst camera and they have removed the IR blaster
  Phone display is big but brightness is not good.  Hence, the user is required to set higher level of brightness for display. There is a yellowish shade in display part. It is a average budget phone.
  Got this phone for my grandparents, i was able to get a good deal on it.The phone has a nice big screen, display is average quality,definitly good for media consumption,the ui is clear, MIUI is easy to use.The camera is poor thoughbut if 10K is the budget, this is a go to phone, hands-down.Definitly a good buy!!!!
  The photo quality is worse compared to any phone in this budget.The build quality and color are good.Not seen any performance issues.. I'm only dissatisfied with the camera.. Very bad quality of pictures
  Don’t buy this product .its worst product of this range.Image quality is below average comparing with the specification.And there is NO RETURN POLICY and REPLACE with same mobile is worst thing about this product or company.😡😠Total waste of money......DON’T buy this mobile ever
  Mobile charger getting heat after connecting 5min. I decided to replace the product and i fill all details and send it Amazon now they are saying we didn't receive any returns message from my side..... Better you go to serive center and claim there only we are help less.
  Do not Buy 5G wifi not connecting and helpline number is not capable of helping... so its false marketing
  The display suddenly goes away.The calls get hung.What's app call gets  disconnected and it does not reconnect again nor allowes other person to call.Given a chance we would like to return but that window is closed nowBattery life is good and camera is not working t bad.Finger print is nit tried so far.
  I bought this for my mother in law and she expressed that it is not receiving the signal properly where as my father in law samsung at the same home same location is working all fine with same service provider.
  OK, Phone for a regular user.* Use for a month and heating issue if play games or in charging.*Battery is not as per details, only one day use.*Gave it to mother as it was not for a regular user phone who wants To watch Heavy Videos,Surfing, Browsing, Calling. (Forget about heavy Gaming)*Camera is Ok, could be better.* Overall Good Phone for users who just want a smart phone with not heavy usage.
  It's a bit laggy when you play games like among us or roblox on it. Else it's totally fair for the price. And the problem which I am facing the most is this phone is very heavy and it's horizontally long and vertically small. This makes it very hard to hold the phone in one hand. Also there is actually only 2 cameras whereas when you look at it from outside it d look like it has 3 cameras. Xiaomi please fix this as no one wants an unnecessary camera just for show off.
  While transferring data from my existing Redmi,the new one shows everything recd but when opened I see a good no of apps not transferred .GMail tfd bt wd only 6/7 mails .Uber,Ola,Yahoo mail....and bank apps not moved.Now while downloading a bank's app it is just moving n moving .So slow from my old mobile ! I dnt know what to do with it .
  Best of the best under 10 k . I bought this for my dad. he really liked it. Thanx mi
  I thik it is the best product in this range of smartphone devices. Camera quality is good with AI, but need to improve more. battery life is sufficient for the whole day continuous use. Fingerprint sensor is working smoothly. I mostly use it's focus mode feature to spend my time in fruitful tasks and stay away from any kind of distraction. Overall it is a good product. I like it.
  I HAVE BOUGHT THIS PHONE EXACTLY ONE MONTH BEFORE FROM TODAY.IT IS 17TH FEB 2020 AND I BOUGHT IT ON 17JAN 2020.ON THIS DAY THE PHONE SUDDENLY STARTED GLITCHING ON IT'S OWN.THE LCD SCREEN IS NOT WORKING.THERE IS NOT ONE SINGLE SCRATCH OR DENT ON THE PHONE.I WAS WATCHING VIDEOS ON IT.I KEPT IT ON THE TABLE AND WENT TO WASH MY FACE.I CAME BACK AND SUDDENLY THE SCREEN GOT TOTALLY DISTORTED.NOT AT ALL GOOD.
  Recently I have purchased this mobile and within 15 days mobile's problem occurred. This mobile automatically switched off and then switched on... Again I have faced same problem and now this mobile is not working...... Amazon guys straightly avoided my problem by saying about their 7 days return policy..REDMI Service Centre address which is given on Internet also faulty. I have personally visited 2 service centre but now they had shifted elsewhere......
  Within 2 months the device showed issue by not connecting to mobile network. Tried re- booting and re-inserting sim but nothing working... It was really frustrating experience.. Primary purpose of a mobile phone has stopped working..Called Service centre and I was informed about a couple of steps including some updates and factory reset. There was some issue with the software updates, which was supposed to be automatic OTA. If an update (which the user was not aware of) stops the phone to connect to a mobile network, then it is really tough to debug, if someone is not there to help you with the required wifi or technical expertise.
  Camera quality is very bad. Also it started to hang while using. My mother in law is using this mobile and she only watch YouTube and use it for making and receiving calls. Sad.
  An amazing smartphone from Mi with all the basic and lovable features needed for me within the price limit of 8000. I got this phone for 7499 rupees for the 4+64 GB variant. It is among the few phones to give 4GB RAM under 7500 rupees.
  I bought this mobile for my mom and it was a huge upgrade for her as she was using Redmi 4 earlier. Also I got Rs 2200 discount for the exchange. Overall the mobile is pretty good for daily use. She can make video calls from Whatsapp, browse facebook for a while and watch youtube videos. I have noticed little bit lag while opening the apps but it's not significant. Camera is okay for daytime photography. Overall I will give 3/5.
  Music player automatically slow down in the middle of the song playing, please response this problem.As per this model of mobile, camera needs protection of back cover because without back cover camera not in a safe position when anybody uses this mobile and puting on table or anywhere.I don't like this you don't provide back cover for this mobile. As per current situation of covid, shops are not opened,I am not able to buy back cover of it
  Battery is good, fingerprint sensors are average, screen size is good and works well under bright sunlight.Coming to the camera, camera is below average, I compared the camera with realme 1 phone and picture quality of redmi 9 is poor as compare to realme 1.
  Issues are arising when YouTube videos are played. It is hanging. Charging  is too slow. Even processor is slow.Shall update after 1 month of use. Hope it survives that long.
  Redmi 9 mobile I was bought a month ago but now phone showing hanging problem it's really shocking to me internal storage 4/64 but i always face hanging problem it's very unfortunately but it's true my opinion to new peoples think about buying this mobile please avoid it.
  I really love this mobile gifted to my mom marriage anniversary all are best in this price segment ❤️ love this Best phone all specifications and fingerprint face unlock works fastly and sim network work perfectly loved it thankew so much Amazon great Amazon all services and delivery on time as always 🙏❤️

   Fingerprint is not working,display is not working after getting the phone I was so happy but it disappointed me after 10 minutes as the screen strted blinking, touch is not working,anything gets typed automatically again everything is fine after 5-10 minutes and again it started the same. Refund should be given to a customer because how will the customer trust on you whether the replaced product will work fine or not for few days month or on the same day. I want refund of the product.
  It's a worst mobile phone i have seen ever in my life.... It's very slow and lags frequently during any operation... If there is negetive rating facility then more than 75% people give it negetive ratings... The person who is happy with big screen without any other logic they can give this positive rating for such a third class phone at this high cost....
  (1) Camera not good at all. (2)A tempered glass should have been included in the overall package. (3) An earphone set would have been handy.(4) Battery susceptible... Says 5000 MAh but I'm not sure.(5) Charger head gets heated up in no time.(6) Says 64gb internal whereas 12 of the 64 is already consumed by in built apps.(7) Till date can't easily find accessories online like what is there immensely available for a Redmi note or a Redmi prime.
  It was the best decision to buy this product #redmi 9Thank to my friend and #MIIt has so many features in such a affordable price, so really looking forward to this
  Redmi 9 was not good..  After seeing the reviews in Amazon I bought this mobile but camera quality is very poor.. It's been 15 days of using this mobile it's hanging and while speaking others in the call can't able to hear our voice.. I wonder whether this is real product or duplicate I received.. I thought to return this but we opened this package very late ..till then the exchange date is completed..It's not the worth of 9k..Think twice before buying this..
  From the very 1st day It has a connectivity issue during audio or video call..after lodging a complain and exchange , they called and said you need to take your phone to nearest Redmi service centre. They didn't take any responsibility. Even according to order they should visit my place to check the phone. But they didn't..they just called. And I requested for exchange within 7 days of buying. Pathetic experience.. ...
  Had purchased this for a relative, who wanted a budget phone with features that can be useful for her children attending online classes. It was pretty comfortable to use and the performance is also good. If you are looking for a budget phone, this is a good option.
  If you are looking for good camera quality then this is definitely not the phone you are looking for.This phone is good only for long battery life and nothing else.This phone was bought for my sister who doesn't use much but still she wasn't happy with this.This is not worth buying.
  Using K10pro-very happy and contented, purchased this one without thinking twice, charging take ages, desktop browsing is very unfriendly, do not have type C charging, over all not to happy with the product.
  It is one of the best in helping me in making content of tik tok.It is better than Double Apple Iphone XXXS max pro
  Please don't purchase it because it's processor is very slow, only after 15 days of using it showing as like hanging problemIt is processing like keyboard mobiles not touch phone, battery performance is avarage, if you use it single handed mode then it work normal not good, I am very disappointed with Mi, my old vivo v1 work batter then it. So be careful and with 2-3 thousands more spending, buy other brands batter mobile not it
  Its good for parents. Not for youngster camera quality not good in back side they showing 4 camera point but its have only 2 camera 1 flash and 1 dummy design i brought to my mom so....
  Looking good but Product quality is not good as the value. And there's no any earphone, tempered glass and back cover with it.
  When i have received the phone and unboxed it, it was pretty good but the system inside was also good but when i started to do something like typing or any other work the touch doesn't work. When i touch any application or any thing on the screen everything happens automatically. I cant to any work in the phone. Phone has got lagged and everything is automatic in the phone. Being a new mobile everything is automatically happening.
  Redmi mobile can't be compared with any other mobile brand.its unique.as fas as my experience of using redmi 9 is concerned it's the most efficient and not high but highest quality of product I have ever usedAlmost all brand of mobile smartphone I have used but redmi especially redmi 9 is simply excellent.i recommend all to those want to purchase a  quality budget phoneThank you
  Review after long usage.Positive points - battery backup is good. Charging time is ok, as it 10 watt charger.Display is very good, can be visible in sunlight also. UI is lag free.Negative points - No compass, vital features like screen pinning, split screen removed by company.
  Didn't expect such product from Mi. Very low speaker sound compare to redmi 8A which is chipper then this. Performance is also very lagy. With only whats app use without installed any games and apps no smooth operation in phone.
  This phone is good and if you want to buy a budget smartphone then you should go for a but if you want to buy a gaming smartphone then this phone is not good because while playing games the phone is very lacking and I can't play the game properly so if you want to buy a budget smartphone then you can go for it but if you want to buy a gaming smartphones so don't go for it. And its battery life and camera quality is also good.
  A good phone for the price, considering the fact that I researched the features and settled for this phone fornits battery back up and price range nothing to complain about. All advertised features present and working well, bought it for my mother so her requirements were a big enough screen and good battery back up which matches this phone...very happy and content with the product.
  Quality is very bad, my opinion is to spend some more but don't buy this.Display is very dull.Touch speed is also slow.Camera very bad even i feel this is 2MP instead of 5MP.I brought through EMI, so they are not returning this product. If you are doing same trying with EMI to buy this, Please don't do that because they won't return and you will left with this phone to use which is very irritating.
  Don't buy this.You wasted your money if you bought this.Redmi 8 is better than Redmi 9 in over all performance.Finger print reader is wrost and mic 🎤 is wrostee then wrost. None can hear you from other side without literally like barking.
  Just an ordinary Rs. 6000 phone type.  Just quad cam lookwise is a great feature.  Otherwise no good pic quality, display also poor.  Bought this on flash sale for 10,000. Overall, average product. 😑😐
  Product is good BUT Don't expect fingerprint reader would act as a guard to prevent unauthorized user to access it. I purchased the device for my mom and added her fingerprint expecting only she could unlock it. Much to my surprise, everytime i put in my finger on the sensor, device gets unlocked.Camera quality is okaishSound is bit slow on ohone callsBattery life is decent according to the price range.
  Worst product i ever used,,this mobile getting hanged every time ,,already software update,,factory reset and clear cashes everything done but still no use..when ever it hangs i need to click on power button then again it will works,,same happening for last 1 months..i purchased this product before 4-5 months..i didnt expect this kind of a failure product from Mi...
  At first the battery life was amazing, I could go the whole day without charging, now it is started to lessen faster.Good camera for the price.Touchscreen is very receptive and good.Fast processing.One flaw I found is the ultra saver mode of the phone stopped working within a month. It was so beneficial to keep the phone on during the night and now whenever I click on it the phone restarts.
  Dont Expect too much from this phone.GOOD BATTERY LIFE- but takes a lot of time to chargeDisplay is ok- Sharpness is missingCamera is decent for outdoor shoots. Indoor it is just ok.IR blaster not availableDisplay size is huge so good for watching moviesLight weight phone.Potrait mode is good outdoors only.
  Please  don't buy this mobile, such a worst mobile.Camera is utterflop, navigation is like china guys face only.Picture quality is worst.Phone is very slow in switching between apps.Sound quality is not good, it is like some speaker sound in olden days functions.I request you to please don't buy redmi
  First you people show us we can replace and return item, and after delivered if product not good and we have to return or replace with another item then you will show us policy that it cannot be return and it only replace with another piece...Poor customer support and phone Redmi 9 is bad and poor camera quality....
  Good thing about phoneAverage camera, above average battery, nice speedBad things about phoneWeight, low camera pictures quality,High price, and very important it's display it's is so low you can't see in sun light, low display brightness is most difficult as compared to other phone .
  Every thing is good and awsome look but only one disadvantages is that it doesn't have mi remote sensors. MI phone are mainly famous for mi remote. And this redmi 9 phone is too long and according to long it's width is low. It look awkward.
  The said phone which I ordered on October 2021 received without any problem from Amazon. Every thing is ok but the camera quality is very poor also it looks like a cheap one due to his plastic cabinet. Over all it's good not the best one.
  I am using this mobile for a week. It is fast and a really good mobile at this price. It does not have a good camera as it's so much time to focus. And if you look closely, you can see the pixels. But 6GB ram and 128Gb memory at this price, I mean common something has to be bad. If you are not a selfie guy and want performance this is for you at this budget. It is not for selfie queens or cool selfie chapris. Lol.
  I am using Xiaomi phones from a long time and I always recommend to buy Xiaomi phones because it gives you the same features at lowest price than other brands. The build quality of the phone is good, the camera quality is nice at this price range and it have a big battery life. Just giving 4 stars because I didn't find any discount deal on it.
  Redmi phone are always best.
  I had to return because the video were having issue while recording, some times voice will not come, sometimes it says format not supported when i try to play the video. I got a replacement mobile today on 13 sep 2021. When i checked it the volume of recorded video is very low. I requested for refund. This phone has this problem so beware before you order
  Very worst products.. With in a week automatically switch off.. Headphone pin damaged....fingerprint not working...if I buy in shops....I will slap to shop owner....for given this worst mobile....
  The camera quality is very very poor and per details of phone .. back and front camera bothHeating problem is there while gaming ..The quality is so much decrease by redmi..So waste of money now for redmi mobiles ..Paisa waste phone .. So dont buy this phone
  Poor camera,  screen resolution not good, 2 day used after i realised it is worst phone ever  and most important we can't return it. So don't waste your money redmi phones quality down day by day. Purchase other companies phone and good luck.
  Best buy at this price! The display quality is amazing and I do not have any complaint with the camera too. There is no other phone available at this price which comes with 4GB ram. You should go ahead with this.
  Each and every time, the Microsoft Teams app is to be reinstalled and this makes the kids very difficult to attend the online classes in time. It also took a lot of time installing Bank of India app.NOT A PROPER SOFTWARE IN IT
  Mobile becomes slow time to time and hangs often. I think it is poor in speed than other mobile of redmi like mi 4a. I am disappointed. Battery life good. Camera quality is not bad.
  Not recommended for heavy user's/gamers.Goo for average use..Good 🔋 lifeCamera needs improvementAwesome built designFingerprint scanner sometimes not recognise
  Heating problem - Once call is ended the mobile get heated & same with charging time.Slow battery charging - Kept the phone for charging at 15% remaining and after 20 minutes the battery charge was 29%. Means battery percent was not increasing and it take more than a minute to charge 1%
  Please if you are someone who is dependent on phone for work purpose, Don't buy this you can invest in better phone. Phone is too slow and I bought this on 4th Feb and today 25th Feb the phone is dead and not charging. It hangs most of thee time and There has been a lot of network issue, receiver not able to hear (Its not the SIM problem). Veryyy bad experience with this phone. Super disappointed.
  The battery of this mobile is good but the processor is slow on using heavy apps and the touch is not that responsive when using some of the live tv apps. Overall at this budget dont expect this mobile to do heavy taks smoothly and I am giving my review after using this mobile for over 2 months.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   Faulty Device delivered with serious charging issues. The phone got bend while charging and now we are supposed to pay the service charge for companies or sellers mistake. The service charge cost more than 25% of phones total price and customer care says it is out of warranty because of bend issue even when there are no other screen damages or anything which looks like a customer issue. Worst seller and worst customer support. I demand a compensation for my loss
  Best mobile configuration in this cost segment.If you expect good camera quality then check the pixel before buying.Satisfactory image quality found.Front camera is a bit dull though the back camera of 13+2 MP makes it over.Overall nice experience and satisfied with the purchase till now.
  The phone I received was really very nice. The processor and the camera was excellent. I am using it since a month and the I experienced a very nice relaxation while using the phone. The quality of this phone is excellent. The fingerprint reader is just superb feature of this phone.
  At this price range the phone is not bad at all. The processor is not that quick but okay for normal use. Camera quality is neither good nor bad. Less metal and more plastic.
  Worst camera and speaker quality, I want to  return and asking for refund but Amazon did not provide the refund option only replacement available for  this mobile, I am wasted my money by purchasing this mobile, very bad experience
  So I Used this phone and I would like to clear one thing that If you want to take a phone for clicking photos then I seriously recommend you to take other phone but if you ask me about its performance then see G35 is not so good processor so if you need a gaming phone which will perform well for atleast 1 year on medium or high graphics then don't buy this and storage is 128GB so it's good
  HeyHighly recommend if you are a Buddha or buddhi but if you are young go for any 3gb ram phone instead of this as it doesn’t look premium where as other phone have that looksBut if you have to do heavy work ya it can do that but only thing the camera quality is really bad one
  Camera is below average. Battery back up is too food and it does not hang as it has g80 helio chipset. I am disappointed only about the camera. otherwide ot os a noce mpbile considering the budget. One mpre thong.. when i checked the IMEI, it gave me no data regarding brand name or model number. May be a duplicateobile is delivered to me.
  After reading many negative reviews was a bit worried whether the selection of this model was good or bad.But after getting in hand, I can say really 100% that it's a worth for those who don't use smartphones much in detail like camera and all,Feature wise it's a good phone at a nominal price. Operating is good, camera a bit ok ok.Overall rating will be "Good"
  Good product
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   It’s a good one in case you buy it as your secondary one… For primary purpose you can stretch the budget and you’ll get better options.
  After using this phone, I'm really disappointed with it. This doesn't give me any satisfaction which I want from this phone. The camera is okay only in daylight. And also it looks like it has 3 cameras but actually it only has 2 cameras. The sound quality is also not satisfying. My redmi 8 is much better than this. Touch and fingerprint is okay. But I'm not satisfied.
  Not price worthy.1. The camera quality is very cheap.(remember VJA camera 10 years before. It is Just few levels upper in this phone)2. Display is quite low in comparison to Samsung phones like m10 or m20, 21 etc.3. Still the battery life is quite good . But who knows what will happen after use for 2-3 months.Price should be reduced in comparison to qualities of above points.
  Don't purchase red mi this mobile worst battery life i was purchase 1st week of November 2021 but still date battery not working i cant return the item their is no warranty service.no body response if in case desis of mobile with in warranty period also no response.No physical damage this phone but still  CHARGER PIN  not working yet.worst experience with RED Mi
  Although its battery backup is very nice and last for at least one day and miui 12 is also gives smooth display but one thing that should be fixed is face unlock is not working properly it unlocks with two different person of slightly same characters
  I purchased this mobile in exchange with old phone.This is really very good phone in use by feature.Service given by the sellers is very good and really impressive and fast delivery.Really Suggested this for future buying..
  After 1 week of usage I am writing review.Camera , screen resolution, video , gaming experience all are nice.Battery charging taking little time than my expectations.But value for money.I was comparing mi 8A dual & 9A &9 primeBut finally purchased this one as per my preference.Thanks Amazon for prompt Delivery !
  Mi phone is value for money phone especially redmi 9 if you think about phone in 10k range i suggest u redmi 9 this phone has good looking phone battery life is to long and display quality feel better than another phone and processor is good #Redmi9
  I read the reviews after booking the phone and was kind of dismayed. But the phone turned out to be too good for me. Especially in this budget with all these specifications Redmi 9 stands tall among the competitors. As most of the reviews the camera is not supreme but it is appreciable in such a prize. The fingerprint quality, processor and battery life are all very satisfactory.
  Pic quality moderate. Notice in uploaded pic, idol is not clearly visible despite adequate lighting. IR blaster not present. Also magnetic sensor absent . It's used in compass app.
  PHONE IS WORTH OF MONEY BUY CAMERA IS LIKE 1.5 MP , PROCESSOR IS SLOW GAMER NOT BUY IT SPACE IS GOOD , RAM CLOCK SPEED IS LOW.BUT FOR SMALL BUDGET ITS CHUMMESWARI PHONE
  Well Redmi 9 is very nice mobile for this price segment.Review after 2 month and look like working good but bit bulky.Camera is good but not best, not recommended for camera lovers.Battery work good and charging time also not take much time.I recommend for whom not so techno savvy.
  I loved the mobile and it's very super fast.  Little weight on the mobile and it's okay.  It has free space and cleaning further is easy. Overall its very good.
  The phone is really choppy and not good for this price. There are better phone of realme available like the narzo series.Go for them instead of this
  Redmi still using old USB Chargers not C Cable for even new models, USB Chargers won’t last long and always develops faults after some usage so ideally MI wants to u to buy new phones every month. Going to tweet to MI India Boss
  Don't buy MI phones. There are lot of Mother board issues. Worst service. They will charge for checking also. They ultimately steal money even your phone is in warranty.
  Untill redmi stops barging into all private spaces with ads, user will be dissatisfied in a corner using a best phone for given price. Everything is great except those annoying ads. Why can't everything be stock android ?
  This is a good low budget phone. But after a heavy work UI gets a 1sec delay. This device is only for simple works.The camera quality is very poor, sound quality is bad.
  Not worthy for 8999/-Battery capacity is not upto the markScreen scrolling is always laggy Even the company creates a replacement policy of a few days so that a customer could not replace this mobile . Good job Amazon employees u guys suck
  I want to gift this on raksha bandhan but product accessories missing even i told that I will take replacement only raksha bandhan 22nd aug other wise I want refund because after 22nd no means of the replacement... So please refund me
  I've got this mobile for rupees 7600...so, i didn't have much expectations from this but this phone is very good for regular use. I gifted it to my father, he is very happy with itBig and clear screenGood batteryGood lookingBut is has poor camera...like worst.
  Not purchase this product  running products automatically off after use 7 days this produtt is very bad mi service center is no response  iam all ready mail dropped mi service center is but no response  shopping experience Amazon partner is  very bed is very chip vander iam leaving Amazon aap permanentThis is phone is very bed company is very cheap bothoffu Amazon &mi
  The camera is so blurry. Absolutely nothing like the pics. The battery is a beast though. The big screen is a potential plus, or minus depending on how you choose to look at it. The colors are a bit dull, but that's just typical Mi colors. Decent buy for the price range.
  Price is high. It should have been 9000 maximum
  Its very beautiful and very excellent super fast battery life good also improve more long battery life and its compitable with my google meet and zoom classes anyways it was a good and excellent fast mobile in the world
  I you Have 9000 rupees and want to buy smartphone which have 4Gb ram and 64 Gb storage, please Don't buy this smartphone . Go with any other smartphones other then redmi because After some time this phone will be lagging and running slow, apps will open slowly , and also it's camera is worst part of this phone . It has only Good battery and Stylish look .
  Auto restart in 30 seconds. After reset contact saving problem & other problems are found. Very disappointed with it. Technical person are available for visit. Disappointed from Amazon service also.
  The most affordable 4+64 variant in all brands in the sale. The looks is awesome being an budget device. Great battery life and screen quality. Camera is okay but not great.
  Poor display, eyes are getting effected. Poor speakers. Poor camera.Performance is fast as it has 4Gb other than that its not recommended product.
  Overall nice product but battery charging is too slow. As stated in specs. 5000 mAh battery but it draining so quickly as compared to 5000mAh power.
  I am writing this after uses of 15days, battery backup is decent, but if you are looking for good camara then this is not for you..I m very disappointed with the camara quality
  Redmi is the best Android phone with Configurations, & Price, This Redmi 9 is attracted me by:colour,look,camera design, panel grip, Finger scanner, WITH SUPER PERFORMANCE ALSO
  Note value for moneyCPU Helio G35Display HD+Charger 10WCamera 13+2MP,5MP
  Extremely poor camera quality, which makes one reconsider his decision on this purchase. Definitely can improve the quality so can get a good picture, if not the enhanced quality.
  I have purchased this phone after seeing reviews but This phone is not good. I am a Amazon prime member and believe in Amazon platform. Now I am very frustrated with its working and performance. I have contacted 3 times to customer service but there is not good response and phone have hardware & software failure defects.  Please let me know how I can refund or replace or return it.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   1 No warranty card inside box...2 it's not type C nor normal pin (odd size)Beware pen drive/card reader user its won't fit nor other charger pin is useful...Please check before buying... (Check video).
  Phone is good. Processing speed is ok but the camera is worst. If you love taking pictures then it's not for you. Believe me you'll regret if you buy it. On the other hand if you are going it for parents or anyone elder in your family then its good for their use.
  The phone's good. It works well for daily use. There are some problems though.1. When charging, the adaptor and the phone heat up. The adaptor gets really really hot. It feels like it's gonna explode.2. It freezes for like a second or 2. (After just 3 days)3. The processor isn't that great and the camera too.
  Just go for it if you are looking for a mobile with all those necessary features. Camera quality is decent and not that well if you are looking for a handset with best in class camera. Otherwise it is decent in looks and performance.! Overall it's a like from my side..!!
  Super clarity....its having more features 😘🥰🥰😍
  I have buy it on October 2020 now its not working please do not buy it is waste of money its screen is not working 😕 it has hanging problem and I will tell that Do not buy this worst product it is waste of  money .....
  It was awesome and functions. are smooth enough camera is definitely better than my older mi it's clicks clear pics and everything works pretty much as expected...😊😊😊
  I ordered this mobile 2months before. After using it I am writing this review. I use this phone but it gets slow down atomatically. I visited MI gallery to solve the problem. They did what's necessary but again after using for 15 days it's get slow down dramatically. I am really disappointed. It's waste of money.. please do not buy this phone.
  Cheap quality mobile rebranded as Redmi.I bought Redmi 8 last year. It was good so thinking of that I bought Redmi 9.Negatives:Highly disappointed.Worst cheap display for this price.Micro USBPositives: Not much
  battery performance is not satisfied.it is said on the label 5000 mah but it acts like 2000 mah battery.
  The phone start and off so many times in a minute. What this is a nuisance product at one. I dislikes this product.
  This review about bought after 3 months. Good sound. Camera is ok but not good. Awesome batter life- good stand by. Budget mobile. My suggestion is that put D+ temper glass(150 rs only), don't use normal temper. D+ is much stronger and long laster, hard to break the glass when mobile slip down to the floor and no air enter between temper and display glass.
  Battery life good.  Camera results very awful. Display very bad. I recommend don't buy this mobile phone because you will not able to return it and mobile is not joyful.
  I like this budget phone of Redmi,buy it from my mom she is happy with that,it's has nice screen , battery life and camera....Just lack the sound quality where the volume is quite low as compared to other smart phone....
  This was the first time I tried exchanging a previous phone of mine (Redmi again) for a new one. Overall the experience was hassle-free , very convenient and seamless. The cell is great for its price (overall looks and features included)
  The product is very easy to use. All the features are excellent . Camera is good . The best thing is about the battery. It is only for normal use.If you want to use the phone for gaming purpose , then the phone might overheat and the battery will drain very fast.
  Superb performance . Beautiful design, excellent screen, original warranty card. No back cover. No head phones
  The overall product quality is good. Fingerprint sensor is okay. Battery life needs to be tested. Camera quality is okay for the pricing.
  According to it's price it's a good choiceBattery optimization is pretty good but doesn't have a typse c fast charging so takes longer to charge screen quality is also justifiable in this rangeA little unhappy with the camera qualityColors are so unrealistic could be better but overall experience is good according to it's price
  Fitt in my pocket, camera is ok ok, I have already use mi, this time pakeging is not so safe, box 📦is so big according to handset box, it's risky at the time of delivery, other are sahred after some time of uses
  Redmi 9 active बहुत ही घटिया फ़ोन है इसका कैमरा बहुत ही घटिया है Downloading स्पीड बहुत slow है इसका auto rotet stop नही होता है जिस तरफ फोन घुमाओ उस तरफ video घूमता रहता है इससे अच्छा तो मे इस बजट में samsung का कोई  भी फ़ोन ले लेता बो बढ़िया था क्योकि में samsung j2pro चला रहा हूँ मेरे पैसे बेकार चले गए इस फ़ोन को नाही खरीदो तो ही ठीक है
  5mp selfie camera yu cnt expect a good photo but it gives decent photo and overall worth for money no back cover( first they used to give) .sound display are ossmm. Face lock finger lock are good.
  Thank uu Amazon for the great delivery in only one day. Thanks and the product is awesome. Superb go for it.
  Just one word PATHETIC.I am regretting after buying this product.Please please please don't buy this phone. The camera quality is DISGUSTING.It DOESN'T have the policy of RETURN/REFUNDI'm crying like hell. Wasted my 9000 on this USELESS PRODUCT.
  Please do Not buy this item totally a rubish peace.bhoot Hang hota.within 1 month only bhoot problems deta hai.  Please do dot buy this
  Poor camera quality, 13 MP on paper acts like 3-4 MP.MIUI has auto-brightness issue, sometimes it gets so dim that it is unusable.Asked for refund but they are only offering replacement, which will be same another disaster.I'll not recommend this phone.
  Bought this mobile a month ago by exchanging my old mobile. Using this mobile for a month now. It is quite disappointing that I am unable to hear the other person. Never thought new mobile would give me such trouble hearing other end. This phone has not served the basic requirements. Never buy this phone.
  This phone is good for working professional, who want to use it for calling or only for office work and calls.The camera quality is very poor.I am using this phone just for office work, and the battery life is so good, charge one time and the backup is for max 2 days.Over all good phone.
  Camera is very poor,  mobile is very slow. battery is good, mobile hangs while surfing and even during playing YouTube. Finger  is ok.
  GoodGood camera.Battery life is great.Green color too good.Fingerprint is just ok ok u'll be satisfy.  BadCharger cable is not type c it's usb. If it come with type it's much be good.No IR blaster it's a big negative.
  Mobile is good at its price but the camera quality isn't good as shown in Description,In comparison between redmi 4 and redmi 9  13MP rear camera  redmi 4 is good.Zooming quality isn't good.And battery draining too fast .At last not satisfied with product.
  You will face these problems1: some softwares (YouTube, Ganna, phone pe etc.) will not work at all, whereas at the same time other softwares perfom seamlessly.
  This phone is good for children attending online classes and all.Not a gaming-oriented phone.Don't expect high-quality photos and videos.The in-hand feel is very good and all sensors are working very well.At this price point, it is absolutely awesome.And the amazon delivery is really great...Thank you amazon...
  Phone looks decent and slim. The only problem is with apps installed. There are many inbuilt apps which are of no use. There is no option to uninstall which annoying.
  Worst service off Amazon and seller too no one is helping me with refund..... Charging issues camera issue and lot off issues with one.... My fault I doesn't need return policy that it is only eligible for replacement .... Not refund.... Please someone help me with refund.... I am stuck with a item which I doesn't need as per his quality defective .... Nd lot off issues...
  This charges is very good in speed in charging.Body quality is strong and durable.compact in size which makes it easy to carry anywhere. works well with all my iphone and ipad.Durability is good for long time.use this product once because it have good value product.Happy to have the product
  Very good. I bought in lighting deal. Super value for money. But charger is not c type. Sad
  All that you need at a price range of 5k to 10kRoutine configuration and tech spcs of this price rangeNothing much special
  Within two I replaced the mobile due to sudden restart of phone by itself and after replacement also it happened for which I need to rush to sevice centre and then it took me 2 days for os change. hope it works better. But I suggest dont even buy this. If there negative rating I would rate it as -5 star.
  Phone is good but camera quality needs lot of improvement.  Pictures taken with this phone are less liked when it is compared with pictures taken from other phones with similar specs. Battery life is excellent.  Overall value for Money..
  It's really worth for buying on Rs. 7559. Thanks to Amazon for this great phone with this offer price.Camera is good on Sunlight, not upto the level night mode, but we can't expect more on this price.Fingerprint is too fast and Battery is really superb.
  Good battery performance. Fingerprint reader is also fast & hassle-free. Value for money within the price range & i m a happy user!
  The phone is awesome, battery life is also good the only thing is the camera front camera is good but the back camera is bit bad not that much but yes it's definitely not worth it if you want it for photography rest is awesome
  Bakawas fone.  Back button working after just 15 days and fone is hanging.display goes white
  The phone is quite good for the the price I paid however I absolutely hate that it does not have split screen option and does not support 5ghz bandwidth either.. other cheaper phones have those yet redmi 9 doesn't.Apart from that the phone is running good.. worth the money if the above two things are added.
  Worst camera........ Higly disappointed😞😞😞..Display quality is also very poor.. Running video in 720p feels like running it in 240p...😡 Display is dull.....If you have a photographer in you even by 1%, don't even think about buying this phone....It is basically a scam...There is also NO RETURN POLICY by Amazon.
  Product was not up to the expectation and a lot of ad pop everywhere, Even in the lock screen.I requested for return but amazon person agrees for the replacement one week back, however after that no actin till now.VERY VERY BAD EXPERIANCE
  It is good phone but not for decent camera work give black image. Although for this price phone can be purchased but if you want better camera other option are available
  This is a good phone under this budget.. everything is good except for camera quality which is average. If you are mainly buying this phone for camera, I wud say it's not the best choice but rest of it is good. I m writing this review after using for a day. amazon te delivered it in few hours, such a great customer service.
  I bought this for my Dad and it's really good at an 8k price point!
  Camera quality is really poor compared to other device with similarconfig and Price range. Every thing else worked perfect so far.
  Don't buy  !!!!!!!!!!!!Amazon is Fooling us,waste of money ,Camery very low ,System problem ,Many problems occurred after seven days of receiving , Went to centre 6-7 times but not solved yet, (Go for another phone but not this)This is my experience and I'm sure you should not buy this *****
  As the camera is very worst than my previous mobile . One thing is that battery life is good. But the price of this mobile is very badINSTEAD BUY IT REDMI 9 PRIMEIT has 18w quick charger and the battery life is also good and camera is also excellent for that priceRedmi 9  price -(8700)  -  Redmi 9 prime  price -( 9500).
  6gb, 128gb, in Rs. 11000, camera quality is poor, . Selfie camera is ok, screen resolution is poor, and battery charging time is very high, may be 4 hrs however backup is very good. Many other functions are also not there, e.g. ir sensor etc. but as per price phone is good
  My father is using it and as per his usage ,working perfectly finebattery is more then enoughNot for heavy usage
  Mobile purchased on 17th Oct’20. But display loosen from phone on 27th Nov’20.Bonding failure with Display and phone.Approached to MI service centre due to warranty. But service team ask Rs 2750 for replace display and not possible refix with original display.Worst service team
  Very bad camera experience
  So far no issues. Awesome phone. Got in Amazon's sale
  I have purchased Redmi 9 Active 2 weeks back. it's specifications and price really cool.i have purchased this handset for my mother she is really happy for this product. A worth buying product from Xiaomi.If anybody asked me to give a rating for this product.defnitely I will give 5 star⭐.
  Camera is poor , front cam is useless, no split screen , although battery performance is quite good , gaming is also smooth , still think its piece of junk
  Good👍 products xiaomi mobileBattery 9/10Camera 6/10Display 8/10Redmi 9 price is low Good Product mobile Redmi PhoneI ❤ Mi smart phone
  Excellent everything. go for it don't waste your time
  Magnetic sensor not available, EMF app not working.Hanging problem..Complained for technical support but neither engineer visited nor replaced/ return the product.
  Brought this mobile for friend & Writing this review after 1 month of it use, Mobile is not at all good. poor camera quality, imbalance system settings. Few hours of continuous use lead to device heat up
  Without any tension you can buy #redmi 9It's one of the best phone by #XiaomiProcessor, battery, camera are the perfect in such an affordable price
  Redmi note 9 pro is just amazing as it has an excellent powerful processor, also with a decent macro camera and also imagine with a great battery storage too. I usually suffer with storage issues but this phone had fulfilled it as it has a storage of 64GB.I recommend you’ll to buy this phone as it’s affordable and worth it:)
  The phone does not have much difference as come. Pared to Redmi 8. Only size weight and thickness is the difference.Very disappointed with the camera quality.But the bettry life and functioning are smooth and not faced any chalenges till now. I have purchased it on 31 March 2021.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   I purchase more items from Amazon..but this phone redmi 9 orange colour 4/64 7/8/2021.  I open my phone package 25/8/2021.i was shocked. The big line in my display I am very upset i pay 9000. Single not my fault I request please my replace my phone and I didn't put SIM in my phone I request please help me
  There are three camera but low quality..I suggest mi keep only one camera but having good quality.For work and other purpose it is ok ok....In 8000 it's fine
  Hi, I bought Redmi 9 mobile on Feb21 one month after mobile not switched ON. I checked with Amazon they advised to go to MI service center. I went MI service center they have checked and told me mother board issue need to change new one. They take one week to change the mother board.
  Some Time Screen is Stucking and blinking. i purchessed 9499 after i purchesses price is down 8499 why??? so i desided for go forward. thanks but overall phone is best
  mobile is very good, look is also pretty and light weighted this mobile price is worth,  comparing other this is best one choice of 10000 rs.Camera quality is also good but according to me this should be little more better and some changes required like default theme and removing application from home.
  #MI redmi 9 has working fine and smooth.Good one battery life  .even I playing pubg on it low heating and giving good performance .Cost of MI redmi 9 is worth.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   Really 4G Volte,dual sim with 5000 mah battery & fingureprint sensor & face unlock.Camera function very well. Battery backup  is nice after using 8 days. Best phone under Rs.9500.
  Waste of money , after using 1month the touch was not working properly and and again I have to lock and unclock the phone then touch will be workAnd there is no replacement yet
  Good phone for the price range, I bought this for 9499. Good camera for this price range and battery is excellent. If you buying this for gaming, please dont buy this PUBG is lagging even in low quality graphics. Except this phone is overall good.
  The display is faded out and not great compare to other MI phones so please check other phones of same brand instead.
  This product is too worst it is not woking for 15 days in a day, we have to of it and on so i have to change this product. So i want to change this item it is strucking so much i want tochange this item. I have taken this product only 5 months ago. Please change this product. You have given waranty
  I bought for my mom. Sound quality very poor.. Sound is very low. But easy to handle mobile and battery has good life.
  its our 6th redmi phone in the last 1.5 years. From daughter to grand mother every one uses redmi.  all are happy with the devices.
  SUPER SURPRISING - This model doesn't have gyro / magnetometer to support Digital compass. Thus, will not give North direction..If I try to return, it says technician will visit to rectify the problem !¡ !¡ !!!!
  Please go for realme c3. Don't go for this phone as realme c3 is with G70 at same price and very good camera quality as compared to this phone which has G35 processor which is quite laggy sometimes. You can buy realme c3 from flipkart at same price.I have both phones and would recommend realme c3.
  Throw the product in dustbinThe colours shown in Amazon and what we receive are totally different.I thought of Changing the colour but it's not possible they said..If you can't exchange it then what is the use of online shopping.Mobile is also not as per the standards..Don't buy from amazon
  Mobile is good at this price, Plsease dont expect good camera quality. Sound is so low that not able to hear anything on speaker untill volume level reaches to half of maximum level. Battery life is good.
  Heats up very fast and gets switched off on its own atleast once in a day. Will not recommend it to anyone. It has yet not read my SD card.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   Mobile is colour is so cool. I bought this mobile for my mother. She is very happy to have this mobile. Thank you Amazon. 🥰😍🤩
  Just grab it. Please don't focus on negative reviews it's a wonderful phone under 9000k.Everything is perfect as per price.
  Mi prime is very bad Mobiletotal wastage of Money.plz. do not buy.it also doesn't support 128 MB micro sd card.
  Display and camera quality is not up to the mark, overall performance just fineFed up of redmi ads.. too irritatingAdd few thousands more and buy better Samsung phone..
  I'm writing this after using redmi 9 for 6 months... It's a nice mobile economically. I was looking for a mobile under a budget of 10,000 and this one was a good buy. I've been using it for my online classes these months and it performs really good. The camera quality is not extraordinary. But it's upto the mark.
  This product or Adaptor is not responding or not well to charge a phone or mobile. But the data cable is okay. I have warranty in 6 months. Please accept my request and return my Adaptor. I ordered a mobile Redmi 9 in July 13th 2021. Please confirm to me and how can I claim that to return or replace that product.
  Good product for people who use for calling, video and basic multitasking. Haven't seen excessive heating or any lags with minimalist use after 5-6 months of usage.
  For this price it is an excellent phone. Works really great. Looks stylish. I bought it for my neighbour. He has given good feedback.
  Purchased it for a good price of 7.9k after bank offer.Very good value for  money for the product at this price range. Camera quality is average and good photos are available only at bright lights. Go for this phone if you are budget conscious or want to gift elderly people.
  Lots of problems this phone.. camera low quality...too much hang only 1month phone...slow charging....not full charged
  Very bad experience…The problem started from day 1 ..I thought there is a network issue so the phone is disconnecting and the voice was not clear but actually the problem was with the phone..Please don’t buy this product…strictly recommended
  Worst product, camera quality poor and microphone is also bad quality.Worst product and Amazon service is also extremely bad..Amazon customer service representative was told if product is nit good after replacement. Refund is issued. But After replacement and vecare service inspection.
  Mobile is hanging, as per 7 days return policy, I have apply for return but Amazon deny that option is not hilighting for return and suggesting to download app will rectfy or technician will visit but that option also not accept by AmazonHence Amazon is cheating to customer
  Very bad quality Chinese product . using from past few months,  very worst performance. Do not Recommend to buy.
  Allover good product. Big display, good battery service, value for money product, but camera quality is not good.
  Dont but this phone. Display quality is very bad. Invest 1000 rupees extra and buy Redmi 9 Prime. This phone is not actual Redmi 9 but it is Redmi 9C released as Redmi 9 in India.It is not Value for Money. I suggest you to buy Redmi 9 prime. If display updates are not given it is waste to buy this phone.
  अब मोबाइल को 2 महीने हो गए मोबाइल में टचिंग की प्रॉब्लम आ रही है  कभी कभी टच नहीं मान रहा ऑफ बटन दबाओ फिर दोबारा दवाई जब मानती है हैंग की तरह हो रहा है और एक ऐप इंस्टॉल नहीं हो रहा है दूसरे फोन में कर कर देखा है उसमें हो रहा है पहली बैटरी पूरे दिन में 40 50 पर सेंट जाती थी अब 70 80 परसेंट चली जाती है बैटरी बैकअप भी कम हो गया है
  Device closed suddenly.  Not opening  even after reboot.  Shocked.  Able to answer incoming calls only. This happened  in 11 days of purchase.  Very disappointed with functioning  of the phone.Visited MI service center in Madhapur on 16-11-2020.  They rectified the defect.  Now my phone is working.
  It has USB to micro usb charging. I was hoping it would be type-C.Speaker sound could have been better.Otherwise decent phone.
  Dont buy anything from amazon. If product is defective, the amazon replacmnt policy is worst. Amazon arrnge a inspection.....  A technician inspect your phone.. And asure u tht it will be replaced. Bt at same tym the technician gives "ok" Report to amazon. And your prodect will never be replaced.
  Handsfree not available on this phone and sold propertier mobile number not in bill ...but mobile is also good but camera result not  better
  Very low quality phone experience is horrible don't buy
  This mobile is good at this price range.Except display HD and all feature are goodIt would have better if it comes with FHD display.Can go for it if you looking mid range of mobile.Worth for Money
  The phone camera was defective from the beginning. Requested for replacement and got replaced. Now working. Have wait for few months to know performance.
  It is the best phone i could get at this priceIt gives detailed description of its different features and usage that other phones do not even mentionIt's working totally fine...love it
  Very bad product I have accepted the product with broken seal from one side when I told to refund it that time amazon member told that we can'tDon't buy this productAnd amazon helpers r also not understand customer problemAccording to them customer money is nothing
  I liked this phone very much , it is budget friendly , provides good battery backup , display quality is also good but It's camera is not upto the mark . If you want to click some good pictures then you should not go for this product otherwise it is pretty decent for every day use .
  Within one month FInd my device is not working properly and I was forced to factory reset and smart messing it needs to be improved. Both the issues not because of the device because of the MIUI operating system that need to be rectified.
  Good but 5G Wi-Fi not detecting
  It's really  good and easy to use..  I was very particular on buying a phone as it is for my in-laws to use. As they are aged I wanted a very user-friendly one.  This is just serving the purpose..  Sound camera quality and clarity are just awesome.
  We brought this phone as a gift and haven't really had a chance to understand and use the features. However, we did see the phone while unboxing. The design of the phone seemed to be great, standard specs for everyday usage. Overall a  great buy!!!
  Awesome for the price good phone overall Amazon is way ahead of other services since I tried to place order last month on different app but they could not deliver even after 4 weeks
  Budget phone in 9000Fingerprint sensor-fasterBattery life - goodCamera quality-averageDisplay clarity for video -average
  Phone is okay for womenCamera quality very badProcessor is okayDon't buy if you are selfie loverAverage phone just for normal usage
  Waste Mobile from Redmi, please don't buy. Waste product from Amazon. I don't understand how the quality team of Amazon had accepted the product, don't they compare with phones with lowest price. I request everyone don't purchase the phone1. Camera waste2. YouTube video quality is not so great
  Redmi 9 looks nicely, but the phone is slagging with even 4GB and 64GB. This is unexpected. Also the sound quality is not clear. There is no return or upgrade to this phone. They only have replacement policy.
  Large Display, Better performance at low price, the hyper engine provided by Mediatek makes the gaming experience smooth, and 5000 mAh battery provides uninterrupted services throughout the day.#mi #redmi9 #mediatek #hyper_engine
  Heavy and hanging sometimes
  Display problem within 20 days from the date of purchase. Replaced the display for free of cost since the phone was in warranty period. Cheap phone and value for money.
  This is nice mobile in this range. I am satisfied with Working performance. Don't expect camera quality but it's good enough in this cost, front cam is just for style😂. Display brightness is low compared to other brands. Speaker quality is also good.unlocking features like fingerprint also working good.
  useless phone I thinh this not origional.camera very poor quality and toch is not working properky. and also phone is hanging. I retuned this prodct but they told to technician come and check the mobile but nobody has not come but they mentined  case is closed. very worst amazon services I lost Rs.8500.
  Comparatively very good product in budget. A little change is advised, battery charging should be auto cut off after fully charged, this function may make this product excellent.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   Built quality is no good. The phone got automatically bend after use of 6 months and after service center visit they said that it  not genuine products and all.
  The phone developed display error on the 9th day from arrival date and Amazon refused to accept as the return / refund window closed the previous day.  Unfortunate.  Not helpful.  Product not dependable.  Waste of money.  Not a good quality.
  I used  that the product was quite good. There are at affordable price. I like RAM and ROM it was nice 4-64 quality of display is quite poor than the other samsung galaxy phone. There no compass option in this phone. I thought it was bigest feedback of this product. And the quality of camera is poor
  The product lookwise is good & having a huge display as compared to other mobile phones. At the same time the camera quality is very poor. At this price you can easily get a product with much better features, anyways not so bad & works for me. Still testing as it is just a week of using it.
  Purchased for dad and everything got installed with successful backup. Battery life is really great along with other features.
  Must buy product and phone works fine - by running 2 applications simultaneously ! And has all helpful  features ! 10/10
  In this product, they were said Memory is 64GB, but if it see in filemanager options it shows only 55GB.something have technical issues happened in this product.Pls ensure it before buying this product.also return policy not available only the replacement options available.
  Phone is Good but the spects seems average as compared to other new smartphonesLike1. The camera quality is below average, You can get much better quality with some other phone2. The System seems laggy as updated to latest android versionI don't recommend this product
  Go ahead and buy it.At first I was confused butt you should go with thisI know it's chinese but it's nice and not soo expensive.So my suggestion is to buy it
  No complaints it worths for what we pay after all card offers its good for elder people or normal usage
  Very bad experience, I didn't liked the product and I wish to return the product.However the product isn't being return and now return window has also been closed.Tried calling customer care,it didn't work.Please help me in regards to return the product.
  See this smartphone could be used for daily uses. I tried to play games on it, it was ok but it affects the phone. I occured a major display problem and it was so frustrating. I recommend this phone only for normal users. Not for playing games. Camera was better. Overall a good normal using phone
  Received a defective product.. packaging was not proper. Phone doesn't start when it is power onn nor does it starts when it is plugged in for charging. Have asked for replacement but it is still not cleared when i would receive the product. Totally helpless..
  This Smart Phone, I’m using more than 1year, It’s very good and no hanging with lot of photos in it and using with n number of apps, still now running smoothly without any hang, 2day batter life
  If you want to play pubg, Fo t buy this phone it doesn't have gyroscope sensor and screen display is low camera is worst never expected this from Redmi, battery is just for saying 5000 mah but its not that up to the point. Go for some upgraded phones by adding 1-2K more in which you will got more
  Best phone under this range 😍😍. Excellent camera , well features , smooth experience.I really recommend to everyone who looking for best phone under this price range. 👍🏻👍🏻😍😍😍
  Nice budget phone. Back Camera quality is very poor. Except that a good phone for our parents and grand parents.
  The worst product from amazon.. I should have purchase it from flipkart. My last purchase from flipkart was very good product but this time I've choosen Amazon which was my wrong decision... Worse product hangs 10 times day the touchplay doesn't work sometime
  #Redmi_9 marvelous phoneMarvelous battery lifeMarvelous camera and phone performanceValue for money also
  I received the product in time and in original sealed box but the touch sometimes did not work. The problem was solved by Redmi service center after replacing the touch and display as without any cost.
  Good phone in the price range but not the best. I'm using redmi for six years or more & experienced several models, the main issue is their buggy MIUI, always a new update comes with some solved old bug but with some new bugs as well as!
  Best Android phone is affordable price !!!Amazon serving is top class, Exchange service is awesome and no any silly Question ask while mobile replace and is very smooth process.Must buy everything from Amazon only!!
  My first mob from Amazon having very bad experience as it's just like "local market"product having camera worst "blurry images"even in the sunlight ,display is poorest , picture quality dull and no refund option ...Worst and last shopping from Amazon ....Very unsatisfactory service in all aspects
  All time hang and reboot auto off on
  I got it at 8500 and as per price it is goodDisplay is greatCamera is not too goodBattery is great
  The phone is not worth, it is getting really slow in just a month after purchase, which is not acceptable. Camera quality is very poor. I would not recommend anyone to buy this product.
  I bought this mobile 1 month before. But, Do not know, why mobile hangs frequently.. I do not have any gaming app. and just used  25%(14.5 GB) of storage. every time, i have to press the power on/off button then only i can able to use the mobile.WHAT IS THE ISSUE ON THIS MOBILE....?
  Perfect product for your mom or dad who uses it only for whatsApp and YouTube. Battery life is good, stands for 1.5 days. Camera gives VGA quality but that's ok considering the price. Battery heats up if you views videos in 1080p. No lag though.
  It's not fast charging ,is taking too much time for 100% charging.Touch sense  not goodI am going to replace it are giving back,I was using redmi y2 which I byback with thise edmi 9,Redmi 9 much slower than y2 it's avareg phone. Very unhappy.
  Really #Redmi9 Is a most Valuable product For meThank you #miI really appreciate your Efforts to serve your customersGood Battery life And camera experience
  Camera quality questions matters!!Kindly check once if you're planning to purchase this product with corresponding camera.Made in india
  Wrong product.I purchased it thinking the title redmi 9 but the product title and specifications are of redmi 9c...so not able to connect to 5 ghz wifi...many features of redmi 9 is not there in 9c
  Once you navigate from the call screen to other apps it will not be possible to return to the screen.
  Nice phone in this budget although in the back side they've shown 3 cameras + flash but in the actual there are 2 cameras and 1 dummy.They should've provided type C charger point instead of B type.Display size is attractive enough.
  Battery life is so bad.. Draining very fast, charging takes more time. YouTube while watching shorts it hangs. Gaming is only ok, it's something like a second hand product. Too bad... Please look for any other models comes in this price range.
  We didn't received any add on service like the back case of the phone. We really regret this as we compared with other phones in same brand or the other brand they all receive mostly both back case and tempered glass. If possible you may send us seperately the back case.......
  Really good budget phone..excellent display at this budget and more over its 4gb 64gb we wont get any phones at this budget..camera quality is also excellent guys its very good and value for money
  Again Amazon did not mention country of origin , and Mi had all advertised as made in India earlier. After the phone arrived , I noticed that this is made in China. Disappointed with Amazon
  1. Battery life is excellent2. fingerprint reader works fine3. camera quality is below average4. performance is average5. display quality is not that goodGood for normal use only. If you love to take picture and play games don't go for it.
  Overall it's nice but display quality was Lil cheap and camera as well! Apart from dat everything is OK in this price! Suits to ppl those who uses less like only for kids games&rhymes , calls&chat , social media that's it, And it not meant for gamers!! This is My experience after a month
  The product is an item of handsome features and all of them are running very satisfactory  Overall it can be defined as a "Paisa Vasool" deal.
  Great device at such a price. Loved the look, colour and the touch response is really fast. Factory settings have provided everything we need. Thanks a lot for the deal amazon and Xiaomi.
  I bought two phones for my parents. Orange and blue color. I liked both the colors. It's a VFM phone. Your budget is limited then go for it without a second thought.
  I think i have received a defective piece as there is some problem is coming in screen and battery whereas no complaints comes in Readme Phones but zero percent satisfied with this phone.
  It is a budget phone but it feels cheaper to the touch.... Well designed and smooth to the touch .. only problem is the battery... I drains quicker then expected but for the amout i paid for the product... It was worth it
  Team "Colour of this phone is not as per the displayed picture colour" it's totally different...You had mentioned "Sporty Orange" n in reality it's "dark orange"...Also Quality of Camera pictures are worst then a normal base model...Not a Worth spending any money on this..
  It's not working properly. Sometimes breaking voice. Could not move quickly from one application to other application... It stucks most of the times... Old chargers were sent.... What else to say.... It's not worth to buy... Return period is so. Less....couldn't return it...
  It's just been 30 min since I unboxed the phone and I'm not happy with the performance of the phone. I have not been given option to return the phone which I would want to. Online shopping is such a scam. Would suggest not to buy anything from Amazon.
  Finger print reader, very nicely working.Battery life, good.Camera quality,  Average. Below expected.
  I have order this mobile it doesn't detect 5g WiFi net work I called the amazon and replaced.But the replaced one also same problem so I have returned the item.The latest mobile which cannot detect the 5g wifi its really useless. Don't buy this model.
  The phone is really good I have no complaints about the phone nor the battery; battery life is excellent with the power of Android 10 and MIUI 12.. bt whn I click what's new in about phone it says that u cannot access the update log dnt hv the permission I dnt know why....
  Pros-1.storage2. Battery life3. Finger print sensor4. Display quality5. DesignCons1. Worst processor2. Hanging3. Can’t handle games4. Low speaker voice5. Worst camera

                    The media could not be loaded.
                
Advances System Operating this is a new version very better options this is very nice
  Shocked to see that Amazon has given refurbished phone during the festive sale, although I had ordered a new one.The display was not working properly and when I visited Redmi service center, they refused to service it as it was a refurbished phone delivered by Amazon
  Value for money. Only thing it has a tag/ image of china which is disgusting because the country does not have transparency.
  Allover phone is good, you can go for it if you're looking under 10000/- but you have to sacrifice with the camara quality.. camara quality is not so much good as i expected from redmi.
  I like this mobile very much because of the battery standby time. I have bought it for my kids online class. The battery charge decreases 20% only after using 4 hours of online class. This is very fine when compared with other mobiles.
  Camera : NormalBattery : Very GoodAndroid : GoodApps : MI preinstalled app worstDisplay : Good
  Dear TeamJust three days before I received Redmi 9 mobileBut after three days I realised its not up to remarks...... I need a fast and smooth phone so finally I decided I invest some more money and May be afterwards u can provide me fast mobile...Thx
  One of the worst phone ever buyed even redmi 3s prime is much better phone than this.Common problems found as hotspot 5.0 ghz band not supported due to which mi mover (mi's app) not working plus some apps are not installing.Worst phone don't waste money on this phone.
  13 MP CAMERA still no clear photos. My old redmi 2s was better(had 8mp cam and good photos).Auto focus is worst and slow.Call volume low both on call as well as speaker mode.Heavy weight.
  Great design,Great build in design, Great display affordable priceThank you Amazon for fast deliverythank you MI for great experience
  If you are expecting more you need to pay more, you get what you pay for, you want better camera, get the model up, you want better memory, model up. Better phone, model up. Some how i feel I'll be using this phone for 2 years and then get a better phone😂
  Very bad product, don't buy it. Amazon.in is not replacing the mobile.0 rating for redmi 9 as well Amazon.I have attached phone doctor test for given mobile phone. It is not working as expected. Mic and speaker issue is also there. The product is damaged.
  Unexpected visual performance from redmi and Amazon not even accepting exchange r return . Maybe it is a defective product. Kindly recheck once before placing order.
  Good device considering the price. Screen quality could have been better. But its okey. The battery life is very good. For normal users two days backup is easily achievable.
  Installation is not easy. Google option Page did not appear. Final Agreement Page did not open fully. Phone Sound is very low. Difficult to hear.Phone Cover was not supplied.Headphone was not supplied.
  Such a phone with worst camera. Full of grains in camera. I contacted nearest Xiaomi store they suggested to replace it since they suspect it is a damaged phone but amazon is not ready to replace it.Also the IMEI number of the phone does not seems to be a valid one.
  Phone is excellent but in this price camera is very bad please if you want good pics then don't buy this mobile spend little bit more and buy good mobile.
  Phone looks good and is slim to get a grip on, however the volume isn't the best could do better! Camera quality is ok
  Honestly I can say again it's one more in my budget phone for my family member. They love it. On there birthday.. on time.Thanks for delivery on time. And easy payment mode.
  Redmi9 works as basic handset. I have orders and found touch screen issue. Also the quality of photos are very poor in both from and back camera. If you are looking for real smart hone then for other model in MI.
  There is no other phone available at this price which comes with 4GB ram. You should go ahead with this.
  Disappointed with this product of Xiaomi... redmi, it seeming compony wants to just huge benifit of their fam without focusing about quality & without thinking of Xiaomi fans, proceser is bad camera is bad screen quality also not good, I didn't expected from Xiaomi  like that
  Camera quality is very poorBattery performance is very badI think its my mistake to buy a product online , best option is local market , you can touch and feel the product at least there with live handsets .Online 👎🏾 Local market 👍
  Quality of the product is not good as its getting popular so they have compromise in quality of mi phones , not satisfied with finger sensor as it got repair in a month , and getting hang after a month use, disappointed with quality of the product comparing price
  1.Often apps do not open apps peoperly get black screen.2.Speakers sound is not up to mark.3.Notification light is not available.
  I love it very nice phone good finger print good battery backup good camera quality 👍👍
  Good smartphone with good battery life for normal usage.battery lasts upto 2days.Camera quality is average other specifications are good in this price range.
  camera quality is too bad like 2mp nokia at 10konly 4+128 is main point for this phonebut over all normal for normal daily useage
  I brought it for the camera and battery life ❤️ I'm amazed with the performance!!Go for it 🤗👍🏼❤️
  Good for the price.  Nothing can complained as of now, as it is just two days since I start using it.
  back camera quality soo bad
  Nice mobile..but updated karke ke baad .. automatically switch off and on ho ja raha hai..Agar fir kisi ke saath ho to ek baar sim card nikal kar fir se on kariyega thik ho jigai.Otherwise nice mobile..But delevery man is very rude..Just like so busy
  I bought this @8499 of 4/64gb in offer for elders it suitable for all age'sLooks- goodBudget - fairBattery - goodPerformance - goodNo hanging problem as in Samsung we have to face.Thanks Flipkart hope will get more offers in year end also
  After 2 year it got busted. Looks like very dangerous product. Since I have raised a complaint over customer support and email but no response from them. Very very worst customer support, even no one responding the complaint.Very disappointed with Redmi Product.
  Value of money, phone jab se lia hai lever kharab ho gya daru pi pi ke
  Charger gets heated very much while charging. Mobile qlso gets heated when surfing net.
  Good phone in budgeted price,Only camera quality need to improve..Battery backup is good..This is not 5G phone...
  I loved the gaming experience and smooth screen scrolling what I disliked was that sometimes the finger print reader is a bit faulty but it's veryyy easy to fix and camera quality is a bit poor. Other than these I LOVED THE PHONE . It's a great phone for this kind of cost.
  I bought this Phone but from day one it has problems, while playing video it will have glitches in everything so got it exchanged the exchanhed one has the same problem, this one is slower and has even more problems, the keypad doesn't work and it not worth the investment.
  This phone is not upgraded in terms of latest network requirements. It does not support Jio 5ghz WiFi. It still have older WIFI connector that doesn't support 802.11 AC
  1.Camera is good quality2. Fingers lock working good3. Face lock is very nice if you set face lock in normal conditions and after getting makeup💄  then face lock identify your face4. Phone backup is good battery🔋5.phone is not hitting
  DEFECTIVE PRODUCT - mobile data not working - gets connected to random contacts while dialing or talking to someone - fingerprint pad not working. Bought 3-4 MI phone in the past, all were good, this time received an UNTESTED mobile set for sure. Please have it exchanged.
  It looks sleek and works fine. The camera certainly is a bummer. Does not take good pics at all.
  Simple review, not a product to buy as a phone.You have other options, please go for that. Even sound is not loud, not clear enough in speaker mode. Camera is really worst. I'm still confused is it 1mp camera or 12 mp Or 48 mp in any condition.If you love xiaomi products, this is will be the first who disappoint you.
  This phone is lic for my life having brilliant battery nice dual camera & great features in this price includes charger fast #Redmi9 mi does great work in technical field
  Finger print reader with face. Unlock 🔓 good.Battery 5000mah superb for internet purpose camera quality good.Thanks to Amazon sales and support team.Overall worthy purchase.
  Good phone in this price range a very low price range phone. But teacher was very good I am very happy to purchase this
  If you decided to buy a red mi mobile I don't suggest to buy this product.you buy note series
  Totally not satisfied with the camera...Rather increasing price more than Rs.1000/-...otherwise ok..
  Terrible issue with battery.  It immediately drops down after full charge without even using it.  It's exactly happening on the 6th month of the purchase and the warranty also available for 6 months only. I need a warranty for this purchase to get the battery replaced .
  Continuously switching OFF and ON on its own. Not switching ON completely. I had transferred everything from old phone to this new phone, then it said updates available. I updated and then it started switching ON and OFF. All my time and money are being wasted.
  Phone dose not meet the expectations,Fingerprint is taking time for unlock,battery drains fastly,for full charge it's taking 3-4 hours,Totally waste off money.
  in the long run..its not for multitasking,not a performance oriented phone..i have been using it for last 1 year
  Not good at all.. Camera Quality is worst. Please don't expect much. This is okay for entry level only.
  Mobile eak din tak nhi chla1-fullhanging problems2-chargeging krte time full heating.3.charge bhi nhi ho rha hai.4-sim slots full corated .Call krne pe koi response nhi In madorchodo ko m hi mila damage phone send krne k liye.
  Value for money, best performance rough and tough use , #milove , no heating for gaming mode , camera quality superrr , battery backup so good, and average fast charge
  As I bought it 4 days ago I can't tell about battery life now, camera good, value for money
  Color of mobile is not exactly as shown. Much darker than seen in pics.The camera quality is very very low.The camera result bakvas. black black picture..No value of money. Waste money.
  Super mobile according to praise.
  Received the product, overall satisfied. But sad that Redmi is not giving a screen guard, mobile case, ear phone etc.Realme provided all these stuff along with the mobile.Hence not happy with Redmi.
  Not  used the product. No pin no charger wire or instruction manuel. Slipshod job.
  Found everything good except the camera..Camera quality is not upto the mark.But if you are not a photo freek then you can surely go for it . A good one under 10k.
  Good quality at a good price. Only thing that can be added is fast charging. 1% fulfillment of the product is missing with that.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   A wonderful handset, sleek design and amazing colour. Loved it.
  Decent Phone for the price I got it in. The camera however is not as good I feel, and in terms of it I think redmi 7 pro is better, but the battery life is great and the product came in excellent condition. No complaints.
  Nice features in affordable price.Must go for it.There is no screen gaurd and back cover in the box. They must include it with accessories.
  Review after 4 Months of usage..Like- Design, build up quality, battery backup, charging speedDislike- weight of the handset, Night time the picture quality of Camera is so so even using special night mode..
  I have ordered yesterday n received same day.. right now everything is better than expectation.. hopefully it will be the best mobile in this price.. thanks redmi n Amazon
  SIM ejection tool is missing
  Good Product this price range iam purchase 8599 All cashback and scheme good product this price range
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   Within a week mobile gets hanging and call me option also not working while trying to return the product .I didn't see such a worst product from Amazon .This is the second time I got defected product 😡😡😡
  Just got it, I shall post reviews pretty soon. By the way we are already Redmi familiar fans.
  Charger not working.it comes over heat mobile  charger device is connected
  Thats right..Many bugs in this phoneEvery time call hidden in ur background.Call Recording not working
  Overall Product is good. Back is awesome. Camera is medium not so good. Battery life is good not bad. The fingerprint and Facelock is nice liked it. Buy it is good I think you should buy it.
  Worst experience. Never buy. Zoom gets disconnected several time. You tube gets disconnected several time. Also video Play with lag. I m ready to sell at 50% on second day of buy. Never buy.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   Nice phone in this range. Go for it.
  Good product, finger print reader is awesome in working. Battery is also long lasting , camera quality is good.
  Talking about the phone, battery life is good, camera is not that great comparing other phone in this price range but its not that bad. Fingerprint works great without any issue. So you can go with Redmi 9 activ 4GB Ram-64GB Storage variant at this price range.
  Amazon delivery is good and some days return policy is only Myth for mobiles on amazonBut phone is below average specially camera.
  I liked the phone. As i purchased  it for my husband and he has very extensive  usage and he has a need of phone with long battery  what this phone has. Though  it's  camera is not satisfying  but it's  ok for him. Other features  are gud
  BATTERY, DISPLAY, SIZE PERFORMANCE ALL ARE GOOD FOR THE PRICE RANGE. CAMERA QUALITY OK.
  Images are so blurr. I am very disappointed by Camera quality & speaker. 3rd camera on back side is just for show & unnecessary given.... voice quality of Speaker is low....
  Too big in size, looks &feels odd when attending call from this, for camera, touch response, screen quality like to give 1 star, for this quality of thing 4000/- should be a genuine price..
  Worst experience Personally I don’t like this product because of pricing issue now this time we got
  My redmi phone'stouch and display not working.i gave complaint to amzon customer service..but no response.i need replace facility.it delivered on 7 th october.Replace facility is available upto 14 th october.but no response from Amazon. It was worst experience
  I have facing issue with redmi 9 active, its not good product i think all the inside the parts are duplicate because no limits to hung. Am so upset to this.. we have formatted many time but still not working properly... Amazon team pls take this product return
  Mobile is good option for those who buy for their parents since I bought it for my dad's use and til now I have never seen him complaining anything.Camera quality is goodPerforming good with limited apps.
  MI one of the my favorite brand. It's my Family brand. Since redmi 1 to red mi max.I love mi all product.
  A decent phone for it's price. Not for gaming but good for normal uses. I wish the camera could be little better..
  Good for elder peopleCas its slow processor wiseCamera is just ok
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   A must buy, great for rough use.
  This phone, it has only one different quality that it comes with 4+64 ram and storage, nothing extra quality earlier i was using redmi y2 i believe it was better than this redmi 9 i want to give only 3.5 rating according to quality mark
  Battery works well. Though this phone isn't for genz. I bought this for my dad. So he's happy with that, cause he doesn't have much to do with it
  Thish mobile is very good fingerprint reader and battery life is very good & camera is very good
  Redmi 9 mobile phone is a good budget phone. It's battery life is longer. Camera quality is not much better but it's ok in this price.
  Not a handy device Camera is average not my expectations Network also 4G only Performance normal Battery is good No TPU case inside the box
  This mobile switches off suddenly by own itself n there r many prblms... It's not even 3 months since v bought this mobile..  But it has really many prblms
  I got it for Rs. 8890 on 24 june 21A budget smartphone with Good performance and nice battery backup4/64, 5000 mah, android v10Thank Amazon and seller....
  Pathetic experience!Phone stopped responding after 10 days. Mi support is not good... Do not recommend this phone.
  Old phone was not exchanged just for a very small and only one scratch behind the display.Other than that overall phone was very good. This is not good service.If you are not taking the old phone for this silly reason, you should not give option for exchanging.
  It is good product overall... But its camera is not too good... But otherwise it is awsmmm... any Jelly cover is not there...
  Nice product worked out very well and the usability is quite great definitely worth buying
  This phone is worthless prosuct of Mi. The compass 🧭 is not in this phone when I installed compass app then app told me, your phone has no magnetic support
  Usually redmi used to provide silicon cases, but now we lack those. And the camera quality not upto the mark.
  Rcvd product as per specification. Exchange process was also easy. Thank you.
  Screen of the phone has completely gone. Nothing is visible on the screen. Very bad product. I want to return this product and wish to get a fresh piece.
  I've had it for a week. For now, It seems to be a good phone well worth its price.
  Bill missing hai bil nahin diya aap logon ne Mujhe seal pack phone chahie abhi naya phone hai abhi se itna garam ho raha hai dabba kya kavvari se utha kar diya tha aap logon ne yah phone returned le lijiye aur seal pack phone dijiye bilkul naya
  This Phone is nyc ...with good camera quality, fingerprint sensor , and good battery lyf .... But I usually recieved the problem in phone Calls as I my voice is not clr to other persn and even sometime I even can't here the other person's voice clearly...
  The display quality is very good! Good battery life, options are all good!
  NFC is not available as per spec. This mobile is not like MI brand. Difficult to operate. Getting disappointed from Mi brand. I'm surprising how it got 4* rating
  Doesn't have second space and also you cant exchange this while purchasing any other phone ... Redmi 9 not listed anywhere...also always buy new one only to avoid getting used one.. (I got one like that )
  This mobile comes in your budget and give more service in this priceI like most of this battery backup Nd I like most it's style superb nd colour variation also good.Display quality good and finger also fast overall good in budget.
  For the price it's ok.  Good for kids for online classes . Don't expect for from the device
  Some time fingerprint reader is not work in propar way battery life is like 3500-4000mh (good but it is not that expated)Camera quality is goodAll over it is perform goodSo it is good phone in Rs. 9000And it is made in china
  First of all I bought it because I thought this is a triple camera, didn't saw the specifications basically fooled by the design. Camera quality very poor. Front camera too bad for a 9k mobile. overall performance good. long battery life. screen average.
  I purchased for my father and he likes for easy operating and sound quality
  Package was delivered next day after placing the order. I received the phone with proper sealing and no damage. Camera quality is average. A good phone for 9k when compared to others.
  Overall average phone in low budget. I am just using this from last 7 days. Till it's running ok. Hope I will get quality service.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   Received the Box in excellent condition ! 2 Days delivery with Amazon Prime .....
  Battery life not worth of 5000mAh. Battery draining problem faced from 1st day.
  A decent phone. Does it's job just fine. Not suitable for young people as we tend to use phones with multiple facilities. I bought this for my mother who uses it for YouTube videos, whatsapp messages and calls and sometimes clicking photos.
  After using 15 days I given review.....1. Camera very very worst2. Processing slow3. Battery life ok
  Good performance and super display but camera is bad not worth 13 mp. If you are not looking for  good  camera the phone is great. Good battery great performance ui is not good but ok but camera is poor opening camera looks like playing sd video on 4k
  Very good phone, packed with all great features, 8core, 6Gb ram and 128Gb storage
  Very poor quality mobile. Image and VEDIO Quality very low . Don't buy this product.
  Overall Everything's is good in 9K phone. Performance is good due to 4GB RAM, Processor.Overall worth to take and use. Very good for Redmi Lovers
  A good cell phone with useful features , long battery life and a large memory(128GB).Budget phone with superb features !!!
  Very good mobile at reasonable price.Every thing okay as per description.
  For General use.. this mobile is OK... still i have give 5 starcannot be used for heavy applications and JAVA gamesMI applications will confuse you and overlap with other applications.
  Best budget phone under  nice camera nice battery and display quality is too good go for it thanks for MI on Amazon for fast delivery
  I click the pics and I feel after see pics I go back to 2007-08I request to Amazon Please don't sell this type of phoneYou are a big platform for faith of products qualitySo please don't sell chip quality camera phone in 10000 range
  While being on video call if u see any video or you get a call in between suddenly the volume decrease a lot  and then toblisten you have to disconnect the call and call back again
  I have got this before 15 days and the phone is like a china phone. Camera quality : very poor, bettery : ok, size : ok, touch : not good, weight : too much.
  सब कुछ तो ठीक है साइट पर जाने से अपने आप टाइप हो जाता है कि डिस्ट्रिक्ट साइट पर या कोई भी साइट पर जाने पर अपने आप क्रोम ब्राउजर से बैठ कर देता है या उसी पर रुक जाने से हल करने लगता है तो नहीं करता है रुक जाता है कुछ देर बाद काम करता हूं तब तक करेंगे
  I didn't expect such a big screenOverall good for the price range
  No split screen optionNo video toolboxDon't know what else is removed
  Battery back up & size of the mobile  excellent, camera & sound not meeting expectation...
  Bad sensor and camera. Poor performance and so much hanging issue. Very slow processing...
  It's not suitable for current generation users. Good Android,Battery life was worth and no other special features.
  It is very good product battery life is very good it's a good value for money I recommend to buy this product as there is good value for money
  Same as shown in pics ... nice product ... with charger ... no screen gaurd there in the kit
  Pros - 1. Massive display2. Great camera3. Clear selfieCons - 1. Display turns dim in sunlight2. Battery is 5000 mah but backup is not up to mark3. Missing of type c charging port
  This phone has pathetic speaker audio quality. The voice is not at all audible unless you cling it to your ears. Totally disappointing piece and defective piece. We would like a replacement or refund back.
  For daily use it is ok... Battery runs easily for 2days. Camera is average. Phone is little bit heavy.
  Don't have a Fast charger It's takes time to charge Not given back coverCamera is Not so Good
  Touch screen is not working properly. It is difficult to operate as the touch is not working. Disappointed to purchase this phone from Amazon.
  The ram managment is pretty good. The major problem with this redmi 9 is the camera quality, the photos are getting blurred when u check for detailing. I hope redmi can improve the camera quality in its budget oriented phones
  Good phone at cheap priceFeature are almost same as all redmi phone in range of redmi 4A, 5A, 8,7,9A, ETCJUST PERFORMANCE IF BETTER THAN RESTBUT IF Are looking for phone under10000 then it will not be bad choice at all
  Good mobile under 9k....very good battery life... I am using this phone for 4 months now... As of now it's pretty going good.... Mi warranty is trust worthy too... So go for it..
  Only a few days used, so far so good. No complain whatsoever so far. As usual assured and prompt delivery by Amazon.
  Mi  didn't  Provide  me  with  Ear  Phones.  Camera  Quality  is  OK
  I bought this mobile and replaced it because the mobile hanging issue when we use camera, while opening any apps.. however same model I got replacement and again same issues happening In the Mobile...Camera and battery charges are is good..
  Good product for this price, can be play heavy games and multi tasking, camera ok not beast, battery best for 1.5 days, full charge 2 hrs, no fast charge.
  It's hanging a lot the screen quantity and camera quality is pathetic. Doesn't look like it's 2020 model phone.
  From outside it looks good but it doesn't work properly, gets hanged while in call and not even able to disconnect the calls
  WORST PERFORMANCE, SCREEN SHOT IS NOT WORKING ALWAYS STRUCK(HANGING) THE MOBILE .Dear Redmi please dont sale this type of mobiles dont damage your reputation.
  Audoi quality while watching videos is little bit lower than usual.
  Just bought mobile last month and within 20 days of purchasing it has charging port problem. The battery does not goes above 20%. Even when the charging port is replaced in MI service center 5 days ago,it became worse & it won't go above 5% now.
  BUG IN Redmi 9 (Carbon Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) - Find my device and it occurs automatically after every 15- 20 days and cannot perform any task within 4-5 seconds
  I am still suffering for replacement this malfunctioning  device . Unfortunately I am not getting any prompt support as they are assigned mobile inspection team twice from Punjab and my address is in Kerala .. really fed up
  Please do not buy this mobile phone....now it's hanging too much.Now I'm not able to return it because the returning period is expired.Please Please do not buy this mobile phone ...........
  Fingerprint works fine. After almost a month of usage, there is no visible lag. Storage is more than enough but you can add memory card too. Camera is not that great but still overall this is one of the best phone in this price range.
  4 कैमरा जैसा लगता है धोका है... फ्लेक्स light नही है camera quality अच्छी नही है.... Y2 का जैसा सब same है.... Not Good
  Since I got after 2day half phone screen displays was gone one of my worst experience from this product
  Great purchase.superb battery, display, sound, speed overall 5 star.
  Camera quality worst , everything worst don't buy please or ready to cry , only the thing good is battery life nothing else , 9000inr for only battery, if there is option for 0 rating, I would give it. But sadly have to give 1 rating
  Cemera quality is something we needs look into else phone is superb
  The box had a dent at one corner. The box even looks old but ya product was sealed.
  I ordered for my motherIts so better to buy below 10kAnd so light weightCamera quality is good
  Worst/defected product and worst service provided by Amazon. Slow processor and mic is not working. Worst, thing there is no return/replacement policy. It was showing return option but did not work at all. Online shopping now is just cheating.
  The phone is nice in this budget and except camera quality, you get all latest features at just below 9K. The RAM and processor matches the same as in high end phones above 12k. You may go with this phone definitely if you want a budget phone!
  Real value product with amazing offer in Amazon.Had ordered 2 phones for family and exchanged the old phonesWorking fantastic
  With this price it does not have compass to navigate which makes some apps unable to use. Like sky watch. So disappointing. Even smart phone which cost around rs.6000 does have it.
  I am redmi user from long time, but don't buy this product, camera quality is really poor, they are just using tricks to sell this kind of items, Amazon is not taking this phone back in any situation...so don't go for this product.
  Product build is not strongDisplay is just 720pProcessor Helio  G35 for day to day usage is good but lite gaming it's handlingWhile gaming it's heatingMiui is verry heavy UI it's not satisfiingOverall decent phon
  very nice colour and very nice phone and very nice battery life and very nice colour and very nice designs thank u for redmi company launch for redmi 9 and soap from thank you Amazon
  I have attempted to return the item but i failed.Camera quality is poor and now the phone is not getting boot up and the exchange person is insisting on putting the phone On. Total waste of time and money
  Compus doesn't work. A bit slow. Camera quality is just ok. On the other hand, battery life is great and all other necessary features are good. I think it's a good deal considering the price.
  Mobile is good, but Amazon plays trick evry time. On so called Amazon big billion sale the same mobile cost INR 8799, however after sale is end the same mobile is now available for INR 8499. This felt I have been cheated
  Very good mobile in this price..
  असल में यह फोन मेरी बुआ का जिसे मैंने एमाज़ॉन से औडर किया थाहमें यह फोन बहुत पसंद आया है आप सभी को इसे जरूर आपने इसतेमाल में लेना चाहिए ॥धन्यवाद एमाज़ॉन॥
  this is very good phone by overall performance for under rs 8500.
  When I attend the call 2 second time not any voice. It's happening every time
  Very nice product camera quality is better and blue clour so nice redme 9 is good looking
  I brout a mobile oct 2020 now aug 2021 is really good Woking fingerprint is good battery nice camera good working I love my redmi 9
  I informed that the product was gifted to senior citizen and it came without earphones pls note this and send the earphones they will be very satisfied if you provide it tq
  Worst phone. Almost everything sucks. Worst camera.. doesn't connect to 5g wifi... Performance is also slow. And the make and build.is very cheap. It is very heavy as well.
  Battery and finger print is awesome , Camera quality is not that much high . Purchased this phone for my family member.👍👍👍

   Defective peace delivered by amazon on 05-08-2021 and till date no respond received from amazon service executive even Pick up are canceled in twice.the damage product is with me and my money utilised by amazon.
  Battery is very good 5Screen and size is good 4Camera quality is not upto the mark 3I have redmi 7 whose camera is more clear and sharper as compared to redmi 9 though both are 13 mp camera.
  Except Camera features, phone is supereb and no match with others. Happy to use it since last 3 months.
  This phone is such a waste..My old phone was redmi 5 and still gyroscope was supported..But this phone FPS is not so good and gyro is not supported..On top of that no cashback features and no exchange..Waste of money
  Other app given 700 rs less than amazon.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   Received the mobile in good condition...my mother like it
  Worst 👎phone, don't buy...Heating issue, sim slot or network issue.Network automatically goes off, have to reboot phone regularly
  i am using Mi company phone for last 6 years but this is my worst experence with this phone , heating very much , battery life not upto the mark,and camera quality was not expeceted very bad after rertuen period i realsise this .. dont buy
  Mobile was used for few hours and it got dead, mobile make few noice and got sum colour lines on screen and switched off, Latest mobile with old type charging cable n cord
  I love it... It's a good phone... The screen size is perfect... The camera is good for this price range...
  Worthy budget phone with suitable features, handy, easy to use.
  I received very good product MI 9 from Amazon , no issues with the phone works well, long battery life even with gps and net on as I had to buy this phone in emergency replacement for my old phone, worth for the price
  Not a bad choice in this range. I'm using this for few weeks and my review is-1. Battery 42. Processor 4.53. Fingerprint sensitivity 4.54. Camera 3.5Overall Good
  I'm writing this review after 6 months ofusing this device and my experience is quite good but the only things which i found missing in this device are 1) type c port 2) fast charger otherwise it is the best entry level mobile from Xiaomi
  There is nothing to say I like all features in this price range no one satand you can say that it's a wonderful product with awesome features
  The only drawback is I cannot connect my phone's internet to any of my PC's or laptops. Hotspot of this phone is not visible in any pc.
  I'm very disappointed with this phone it has 4gb ram although it hangs alot and camera quality is also very bad I wan to return this phone but return policy is not applicable on this product. Redmi your phone is become useless.
  Earlier of this phone em using sony phone but I am really love this phone #milove great sony camera best hardware and brilliant ram and storage
  Within  2 months the display failed. Service centre says will not cover under warranty and i have to spend rs 3000 for rhe repair. Worest product, may be MI is using used lcd display in manufacturing which is exchanged from the customers
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   Pros:ColorDisplayBatteryMemorySpeedDesignProcessorFinger touchFaceunlockDedicated memory slot.Dual 4GCons :Camera is upto the markFront cam is ok.
  Camera quality is not that range and heating mobile during calls. Just budget phone it is. No more pros.
  but over all happy with the performance. if you are looking for a mid range phone than this will be the best choice for same.
  Really good Mobile phone at this price!!Can't detect any major drawback but camera quality could be more effective.Overall satisfied with the product.
  I have just started using the product but need replacement of Charger as its not entering the charging slot of mobile and mobile is not charging...Till date I was using the old charger which was working finePlease Help
  Very slow operation , camara is totally wast it's good quality go for mi 9 Note Pro or Max , Not why this Mobil is slow due to mediatek processer I guess

  I have bought for my mother in law and she is very happy with this mobile she is using this phone very smoothly and smartly. Battery backup is also good.
  Well I checked the camera first and it is very disappointing.... but it's a birthday gift for my dad so can't request replacement! Very low quality camera even in a room full of lights.
  The Product is Good ,I know that the AMAZON gives only good product to customers, I gifted to my Grandma this mobile, they felt very happy, everything is good .
  Superb and as expectedWonderful must buy this phones it's good for studentsAnd amazing features for just 9000 is just like impossible
  Really good for finger print, battery life and camera quality.
  It's overall ok. I am using this model for last one year sometimes it hangs even after having 70% free space. And this problem start from early months. Fingerprint sensor, camera, overall ok but not wow.
  Display is very good but the sound output is very low...Battery power is ok.
  Fingerprint reader is good, battery life is all right,and *the selfie camera quality is not so good bt back camera is good the selfi camera , whan i was click some selfies but this is blur *This is my argue.
  The product is good but camera 📸 quality is disgusting/so bad. If you will buy it for other purpose. I bought it in exchange offer that's why I could not return to seller the product.
  Very worst service this time by Amazon and Mi.I received defected fone and no one is listening me.I am going to consumer court to claim my hard earned money
  The sound is not as expectedLooks wise goodWorth for the price
  It's surely a phone with flaws but does the basics just done
  Product is good if you are using like ruf n tuf ... Good battery backups ... Satisfied recommended
  Camera is not working properly..cannot capture any photoEven photo is not getting deleted and even there is not much data in phone showing storage space running outWorst phone of redmi I have ever seenDon't purchase
  The Camara quality is excellent one. Battery is ok. I didn't use fingerprint yet.
  Blue Colour of the phone looks very bad, black colour is nice
  Good at its price and segment works great and good battery backup
  good in cheap price but need to say long lasting battery life
  Don’t buy this product .Image quality is below average comparing with the specification. Useless camera.And there is NO RETURN POLICY and replacing with same mobile is big headache .DON’T buy this mobile
  Charger port not good because this not c port charger port

  Look and keypad short if not Replace so I'm ànd my office call center 800 employee for Airtel UBl unacdmy process not order in future
  VERY NICE
  Company has given 7 days replacement on this phone. Just after 7 days of delivery, display of the phone has blank. Phone delivered on 28 Jan and the issue come on 06 Feb. Very poor.
  Quality is agerage, in same price much more better phones are available in market / online.Customers are requested to choose / finalize any model very carefully before purchase.BE SERIOUS.
  I get it 8999/- only and its good phone in this range . 4Gb ram and 128 gb rom.but camera is not good...camera like feture phone. Battery 3 1/2 * overall its good phone...if you are camera  lover than don't buy....
  Sound is not that much high... didn’t meet the expectations like low volume, less sound while loud speaker on, low sound for music etc... sound quality is not good.
  Best in all the specifications,Highly recommendedMust buy
  Folks except camera quality rest of thing was pretty good.
  Wonderful phone, in this budget it can easily compete with 15k phones too. Everything is smooth and no lags. Battery life is also go. Fingerprint reader and face scannee both works fine. The value you get for this price is insane.
  Mi always my favorite brand.. Actually I will use lot's of band smart phone but Mi is best.. Mi Battery backup impressed me.. Very useful phone making company Mi..
  Worest mobile in my life . 1st red mi 9 ordered that is connectivity issues and returned next same another mobile i got from amazon even that mobile also buttons not working properly i am very very fed up with .amazon and red mi .
  Camera quality is too bad.Micro USB charging.No panorama mode.No remote sensor.No loud audio microphone.
  Phone is good and battery back up also very good. But the charging time to 100% takes more time  (around 3 hrs) no rapid/fast charging
  Quality is not as good. Slowness is the main problem. Also unable to buy another by replacing redmi 9. Model not listed in replacement section.Now happy with redmi 9
  Noticed significant lag while using MS office applicationsEven when thee is no FB / INSTA and other heavy apps installed. To much ram occupied by the bloatware
  it is just value for money, good looking, phone in very excellent condition. delivered on time and all the functions are ok. go for it . u will not find the phone in market on same price.thanks amazon
  Thank you, Very Good product after 10 Days usage felt Happy about the product.
  I order two phone one was camera issue and other one screen flickering. Both are manufacturing defect don't waste money on this phone.
  First one week  only worked,currently The mobile not working how to return or replace
  The quality and build of the phone is below average.But ok for the price range of 9k.
  No much difference between 3GB & 4GB ram... I think 3GB has more faster compare to this.... Same brand mobile used with 3GB It's good compare to this... Even features are less...
  Camera quality ok, not that good. Overall peedormance good, not a gaming device. Display ok. Overall best phone in this budget.
  Good product with qualityIn this range good mobile
  Saab theak hai phone is verry verry goodPhone k back cover Or glass cover ni aayaa
  Everything is fine with the product at this price but the only issue is the speaker.. Its awfully bad.. Video call volume is very low
  Excellent productFull value for moneyIf your budget is less then you should definitely but it..It is worthly value for moneyI like it it's been almost 2month of use but the product is best in this segment
  I like the product for myself but the original & good quality plastic cover is not found with the product as was delivered to other customers. so, I request you to please send me original plastic cover for Redme purchased by me.
  Mobile quality is not upto mark as compare to its price
  I bought this mobile on 26/03/21 within a month mobile not working means it's not getting switch on itself.... Only 25 days is the lifetime for this mobile.... Don't know how this mobile was noticed as AMAZON'S CHOICE
  Good mobile in this price range. Picture quality is also good.
  very nice product buy  good battery backup almost 1.5 days
  Nice phoneBut somtimes there are glitches lagsAnd the fingerprint sensor is decent not very goodNot so good camera but if u swith to hdr mode the camera is awesome
  Nice product
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   i dislike its not working well. its take so much time in back and restore ..its not playing  online music in music app. all over its slowing very very slow and  poor. i really dont like this product .please returned  it. as soon as possible. i can't take it.
  I like this phone too much.. Redmi 9 has awell battery life & fingerprint reader.. Camera quality is not soo gud.. But the clarity is excellent💯. Ai camera is too gud. And this sky blue clr is so charming, above that i expected.
  whether the mobile is correct or not, Amazon service is very good the phone is also good thank you amazon
  Expecting 5G mobile phone by Redmi in June this year, I thought that spending money now would ultimately result in wastage of money if I have to exchange later or sooner with forthcoming 5G mobile. Hence postponment.
  Mobile is good for security & facility by miu . First day 60% charge are going 12 + hours  . But now 600% charges are going 10+ hours . But it is good like other branded mobile.
  बहुत अच्छा है, लेकिन कैमरा क्वॉलिटी सही नही है, ब्राइटनेस थोड़ी कम है, और कभी कभी गूगल में लिंक ओपन करते समय हैक हो जाता है, परंतु बहुत अच्छा मोबाइल है, बजट में भी है, मुझे इससे अच्छा इतने कम रेट में कोई सा भी मोबाइल नही मिला,
  Disgusting phone, dont purchase it...camera quality is very poor.display quality very poor.many features are missing.only storage and ram is ok.
  Pls don't buy this phone.. worst phone phone ever saw... camera quality is worst....and they don't even return..they only do replacement and it is also a headache....this phone is not at all worth of money
  the product is really good. battery backup is good. performance in gaming is good too.
  Very good mobile phone. I am very excited about this.
  Lag is prominent. Difficult to dial contacts from phone book as it automatically jumps to the next contact in the list.
  Problem in finger print reader, problem in voice clearity and some time it's gone in like mute mode in calling timeNot satisfied 😒
  Front camera is not that good. Other than that everything is working good.i got my phone delivered in 3 days
  It's a decent smartphone for daily use. Not recommended for heavy Gaming. The worst about this smartphone is its Camera I have redmi note 5 pro it's Camera it's much better than this smartphone.
  The phone lags for its price point. I will suggest to add a little more money and get a better one.
  बस 8500Rs तक सही है आगे रैट पर नहीं
  Desplay shows purple vertical line,we just opened today because of lockdown it was a gift to mom ,today met with mom,but desplay showing purple line,can we get exchanged our new mobile as Amazon is awesome
  Faulty phone delivered. Within a week the touch stopped working and according to service center its not covered in manufacturer warranty even if its internal fault.I want a full replacement of this unit asap.
  Even if the mobile data is off, the advertisement does the same thing. And if the data is on then more comes and can't do any other work in mobile ... Please solve this issue and tell me how to stop addvertisement.
  Actually no star should be given . Very poor quality. No return policy. Beware .Plss DO NOT BUY this mobile . Phone hangs a lot . Costumer service response was very annoying.
  As promised, ir blaster was not added, and usb type C wasn't there and as a constuner it was a disappointinh one, and 9k product doesn't had these features was disappointing one , try poco c3 atleast it satisfy some features
  I am fully not satisfied with this phone because:-1. At first Camera is very poor quality(no clarity)2. Touch Screen is not good3. Battery drains in12 to 14 hrs4. And Finger print is good but not best
  Sound quality during call is a big let down. Can completely avoid and search for better alternative. Camera quality also low.
  We received items today and when we try power turn ON, phone not able to boot up and hang on showing mi logo.When we try to return the item also the suggestion only book technician. Very frustrated
  Dont buy this phone if you are pubg player because this phone doesn't support gyro sensor.
  Camera poor qualityBatter not stands for longDoesn't get updates earlierMIUI is build with lot of bloatwaresDoesnot allow to change custom rom
  Good phone form Remi again.Bigger and brighter screen.Good battery backup-2days maxTouch and Face ID is awesome.Camera is pritty decent when compared with other variant.
  Double tap for locking phone doesn't work. The rest is okay... Good value for money.
  Product is good but youtube app and screen saver is not working properly
  Camera quality is very poor.  The pictures quality is like vga camera.  My redmi note 3 is better than this
  All functionality are correct at this price segment
  Phone is good in this price point, but charging time charger is very heat and it take very long time to charging. Camera is not good and if phone use more than 45-60minute phone is heat. Overall in this price phone is good.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   Very good mobile I had searched a lot for mobiles under 11000 with 6 gb ram and 128 gb storage camera is not so good or bad but good at this price with remaining features in mind
  Touch response is good. Nice camera. Battery doesn't work like 5000mah.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   Mobile starting setup installation  only not work,when we typing text login account only not happening.
  First of all thanks Amazon for delivery on time. It's very good mobile in this price range. I purchased the item for my brother and he is very Happy.
  Best phone for online classes  battery backup also excellent. My childrens are using this phone from two months for online classes. They are using daily  4 hours.I am giving 2 months review.  no problem at all.
  This seems to be a good device in price range.but camera is terrible and device seems to be slow when ised for a long time
  Nice mobile second purchase nice blue color thanks
  Graphics and  camera quality  sucks!!I have redmi 5A  and since this isn't returnable, thinking to continue with 5A ( storage deficient O/w  it's still better than this duck) .
  Better then samsung oppo vi vo poco even oneplus... With this price unexpected quality. If anybody wants a budget phone but need every updated feature then this is the right choice..
  All specification is good except out speaker which is bad noice earing when play song
  In this price ok phone but battery should have been little better. Camera also not that great
  It is also a good for day today activities and it get a little bit slow after 11months of usage. Camera quality is medium. Software is good but not getting MIUI 12 floating window and other features. But overall good... 👍
  I have always preferred Redmi phones just only because of very good battery back up over a long time hope it doesn't disappoint me.
  Good in 10,000 rupees. Camera & picture quality is ok. 128 gb storage is high point of the mobile.
  it is a great budget smartphone just go for it features are same as other redmi 9 prime everything is same poterate mode is good tooDoesnt works well at night but works great during day
  There is no other phone at this price which is as good as this phone.But only problem is that its camera quality is of little low.And in YouTube you can't experience 1080 p quality. The max for this phone is 720 p only
  I get 7500 OnlyBest Deal with AmazonThank you so Much Amazon
  The phone has a big screen size. LCD display. Camera is not so great. After 2 weeks of use there's not any major problems faced by me. Battery is very nice.
  This smartphone is better than redmi 5 and 5a  beacause my old redmi 5 phone is going hanging after using 1hour and battery quality  and screen is good . But one problem camera is not well my old 's camer is better than thi
  It is good product under 10k.Processor is little bit slow but all ovr conducive product.Color is unique.
  Camera is not good... Better spend 2k to 3k more buy good phone...
  Everything is best in this mobile. For full charge , taking less time to charge full. Camera quality is very best. Fast response while using finger print..
  It's an average phone, battery doesn't lasts long and camera is just ok. I'm giving this review after 4 months of usage. Yes, for the price it's ok
  Poor camera , poor sound quality , poor battery as 5000 mah , slow processor , slow RAM not 4 GB its like 2 GB. Touch screen is not good. Hotspot is not working properly. Overall not value of money
  Really enjoyed, i love blue colour and nice thanks to Amazon..
  Battery is very good in this phoneCamera is simply worst than a keypad mobilesThose who don’t need camera quality this phone will be the best choice !
  Value for money. An excellent piece of mobile phone.
  Pls don't buy this phone.. Phone quality is very bad.... Camera also not good.. Sound quality is very very  bad.. Don't waste money to buy this phone... I suggest everyone buy redmi 9 prime.. Don't buy redmi 9.......
  The device is switched off unexpectedly then gets on. It's repeating. I want to replace this mobile. Still 1 month is not completed. Ian not satisfied with this device. Please find replacement with Amazon or mi
  Product delivered was used and has password locked already. Battery draining like any used phones. Amazon and retailers are a complete cheat and running a fraud business under the guise if discount.
  Value for money !!I have purchase this phone for my friend. He is very happy with this.
  Battery life, internal memory, finger print sensor, processor ,low cost.using for company work
  Battery is nice but lasts a day if you use @ 5 to 6 hours. Takes little more time to charge full battery. Over all worth buying. One star is given less as it is sluggish. Some of the app takes little more time to load.
  Actually I ordered 4GB Ram and64GB storaged redmi 9 phone but when I'm checking IMEI no on website  it shows only 3GB  Ram and 32 GB storage .I doubt this is original set or notThat's why iam disappointed .
  Never buy this phone ,camera quality is very poor I started hating xiomi after using this phone . How company can launch this type of low grade phone . Moreover flash sale by Amazon has fooled me .
  It's amazing and pocket friendly, I brought this phone for my father and my Mother-in-law. The quality is really good and also it's comes with 4gb ram that's a advantage.Really like this one.
  Worst camera quality by Redmi in this category.. It tarnishes the image of redmi.. Redmi should take back all the mobiles in this segment do not buy this version Redmi 9
  Writing the review after using the product for 15 days. Battery life is good, camera is good. But mobile speaker is not functioning properly - audio clarity is not good.
  Overall mobile is good but sound quality is poor..When in transit its difficult to hear the phone ring
  I didn't like this mobile at all, I don't use many applications, still my mobile hangs and  touchpad doesn't respond. Highly dissapointed. Would like to return its less than 6 months old.
  Good value for money mobile
  Very nice phone , very sleek , great finishing all though superb purchase in this price..
  Camera quality is not goodBattery excellentProcessor is not good for 6 gb and 128 gbCharging very slowIf its c type then
  Very nice product. Iam very happy to see this product. quality of product is very good and packaging is very good. I am use this product after 4-5 days and results is very good. I suggest to all person to buy this product. Completely value for money
  It is not up to the mark. Its just like a scam worst camera worst performance and everything is just like a sugar candy without any essence. It is mobile but u will not get that experience for what you are buying it.
  - cheap camera quality..very very bad- too many adds on the phone- phone got turned on by "ad"- music quality is below average- the total product is cheap quality
  I gift to my sister. overall best phone for Daily use. battery backup is 2-3 days. Camera Quality is good but low lighting in Night. Design is Premium. Little lag in Gaming otherwise Best mobile under 10k .
  Selfi camera is worst among all phones, which are used by me from last 10 years aproximately.Battery is good.Looks are quite good.Over all cheap phone.
  The phone is picking 3G/4G signal. Data is working fine but not able to do calls from phone.
  All features are nice I am happy with this product
  Budget friendly. Great Configuration.Gets heated up a little on excessive usage. But, remember. It's budget.Must buy mobile if, one goes with ₹10K as the ceiling.
  Good product. Need to improve camera quality and battery life. Overall good bedget phone in this price segment.
  overall redmi note 9 acha option hai km price rang m bs back cover case ni milta h box k ander jo redmi walon ko dena chahiye tha
  Good product, but cost is excess. Overall ok.
  I was. Using redmi 4 a lower model amd decided to go for this phone few basic features like lock apps and split screen which i present in all phones now isnt there so i was a little. Disappointed
  I have no option to give 0 for 📷 camera.phone hanging every day.dont buy phone on Amazon .I m disappointed first time from Amazon
  Battery backup is good but little backup is needed and instead of usb use c type charging cable and fast charger is to be provided. It is really awesome and it doesn't support high end like pubg nw state
  Battery is good about camera doesn't have that clarity. Like Redmi Note models have.Ordered carbon black, but received blue. It was much need for my mom. So dint think of exchanging.
  Nice product at this price range , amazing quality overall performance also good , TRUST WORTHY
  Nice mobile but camera quality to be improved.Charging indication not there.Phone is easy to handle.Back transparent case not there.All over my review is 3. 5/5
  Overall its good but it's heat faster while playing games and gets really hot while charging + it's charger also gets heated a lot, rather than that it's really good. 4 out of 5 stars.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   Redmi 9 mobile is fine but not good in that price because battery charging is not fast,camera not good,,battery low ,this phone is not good for working work with mobile
  Worst Redmi product I have ever come across. With in 7days of usage the phone started hanging, that too I did not install apps that much. The phone hung in boot screen and I was not able to solve it.
  Battery life is ok but not the best.. phone gets heated up while using some heavy applications like maps etc..
  Thank you for your tremendous help in our new phone. Without your diligence, hard work, late nights, and early mornings we wouldn’t have been able to meet the deadline. Excellent work! Feature is very excellent...
  One of the worst experience.. device automatically switches off every 2 sec with error message’ find device unexpectedly’
  This mobile should have lower price. It's funny that people are still buying the model. I would recommend another product instead of this one
  I am eagerly waiting for this product since 8 days. Now it has been delivered today. Amazon please don't be these much late. But the product is best. Actually it's too good.... 🥰🥰🥰
  It is a very well made phone.It is made in India
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   Got the phone 2 months back . Now all of a sudden without any damage I get these strange display problems . I can't use my phone at all . Have tried hard reset , recovery mode. Nothing works.
  HorribleBad qualitySeems recycled
  Worth for money,. Performance, battery backup, finger print response are good. Cons-Camera could be better, poor images when clicked on low light or indoor.
  It's seem like a china mobile very bad product. Ui is very bad.
  It's lower camera is only show off , not work and many times it's finger password not wok properly . Battery life is just like , ok only to say .I think u should purshches other mobile .
  Phone gets hanged in between. Camera quality not good.
  Fingerprint reader ok and good battery life with a medicore camera.
  Why is it branded Made in China? Really disappointed.
  The old phone has been given only the cover is new and inside this is the old set there’s no network there’s a big issue with the sound .I got a cheated
  I lens in the camera is dummy.....i dont undestand.....This is review after 3 months of usage
  Excellent for simple use.Performance is great.Delivery agent was very polite.
  मेरे मोबाइल बॉक्स में सबकुछ ठीक है पर मोबाइल का बैक कवर नही है। अगर मुमकिन है तो मुझे मोबाइल कवर भेजा जाए अन्यथा हम मोबाइल अगले 2 दिन के अंदर वापस करुंग।
  Phone is of average quality and UI is least convenient as usual. What is most disappointing is the camera quality. If you are looking for good overall mobile this is not the for you.
  Mobile is simply superb and the touch is like feather touch, But both Camera Qualities working perfectly in Sunlight mode. But, In light Dark place or night time the quality of Camera is Okay not best.
  Very poor quality and features as compare to refmi8, no C type cable, no infrared blaster, poor battery life, too slow as compare to redmi 8, I felt let down, don't buy it instead go for redmi 9 power.
  Working speed is better, some times hang while using Amazon, multi task is easy, battery life is good.
  Good quality phone at this price..camera quality could be improved
  बैटरी अच्छी है फिंगर अनलॉक बहुत अच्छा है यह बहुत पतला है और कीमत भी अच्छी है बहुत बड़ी रेडमी mi redmi 9Good productलेकिन Amazon ने बैक कवर नही दियामोबाइल बॉक्स में खाली कवर का खोल रख दिया
  Value-for-money purchase. Quite satisfied with product and performance.
  The best budget same phone in 2020 and in 2021
  I 'm satisfied with performance of product.
  Phone is very slow. When you attempt to make a call, there is a delay of 1-2 secs. At times, Apps take time to open. I wish to go for other model if given a chance
  It's not performing as per expectation and specification.Most importantly it is written made in china on back side. And attached picture can be considered as Proof. Sorry I am going to return it.
  Such a worst phone ever j seen , 2nd time i  am replacing in amazon the same issue persists, phone keeps restarting while doing initial configures performance was too bad very slow. Please don't buy this model.
  Selfie camera is poor as I was using mi note 4 previously same rating camera but picture performance is poor even I had captured photo form both phone and while comparing note 4 camera was having great quality.
  Big display, average camera for normal users, good battery life for two days, large ram, and larg storage,  well play games below 200mb totally satisfied guranted
  Good product, good battery, value for money
  Camera is not so good but its a fantastic phone in this budget i will not suggest you to take phone below this range otherwise it will be a loss of your money
  This product is definitely good..and within an affordable budget.. the camera quality is not very great .. but if camera quality doesn't bother you that much I would suggest you to go with this phone
  If you're going for budget.This is the phone you should go forBattery and Fingerprint Scanner are niceCamera is not very good but nice.
  Quality is lost. Mi mobiles lost the qualities. No only cheap china
  Redmi phone has good battery life for gamer and for watching movies
  Very low sound in both voice and ringing, disappointing
  Great budget phone# display 4/5# camera 4/5# Battery 5/5Overall a nice phone in this range, display is big so viewing experience is great
  Automatic switch off handset after 28days , software not working properly hanging problem on this handset
  Overall the phone is very good but the only thing is it is not an stock Android phone. Other non necessary app which you can't uninstall will always disturb you.
  Display is okCamra quality is below averageProcessor is quite slowIn back 3 camra point.. But there is only 2 cameraOverall in this range this is good if you ignore camra quality
  MIC is not working on calls. The same only works by putting call on speaker. Have complained multiple time and Amazon is not ready to replace the defective phone. Horrible experience with Amazon for 1st time.
  Excellent performance and configuration
  ConsThey showed image like three camaraBut there is only threeSeems like using a duplicate phoneProsWorth for moneyAll other are good
  Didn't get screenguard and back cover
  Average camera🙏Good battery life👌Big screen 👍Slow charge 👎But good product in this range
  Not happy with the purchase. Need to inprove qualiry and reliability. After sales support not good.
  Good Phone with all the features required in a good smartphone. But i would have loved to see a usb type c port instead. Rest everything is good enough for a normal use.
  It's pathetic, it's hanging continuously.This product is one of the worst mobile in my life.If there is any chance to return or exchange please let me know, because all money is wasted.
  Worth it deal and impressive phone in this range less than 9K
  Not good phone, heavy lagging issues,camera worst.
  Amazon is selling fake product. My phone software got corrupted in less than one month. MI product are worth this can't be there case. Its Amazon who has listed fake vendors, I will never use Amazon in life.
  Ordered 4 pieces- 1 of them was defective as sound would drop off in the middle of a call. Be aware that there is a return window and pieces must be physically returned within the window.
  Nice Mobile.  ..... ............................................
  Not worthy to buy. Outdated peripherals.
  I hate Chinese product but Majboori ka naam mahatmaG
  Its too heavy to carry and not easy to use mobile. Not worth it. Better to go for other brands which are lighter and easy to use.
  Good phone at best price under 10,000.
  Not good,..New set hanging and working very slow, the display is too bad.. Cannot be seen well even  complete brightness Applied.
  I connect my hands free it's jack is totally damage . it's not working , and whenever I click on upper volumn button then it's also not working ,  Now replacement duration is also over not able to replace .
  Everything is acceptable but first one is one dummy camera is making foolish to customer & 2nd thing is camera quality is so poor so camera lover pls if you looking this phone for selfi related than strictly prohibited for purchase this one
  I have no problem yet. Working condition is good
  ReminderFor missing charger in boxProduct fine we use regularlyI have old charger but where is new
  Huge fan of redmi series but disappointed this time. Bad camera poor processor and provided 2w charger instead of 10w specified on box. I am providing the back of box too.Not satisfied this time
  Getting hang and facing problem with touch
  The product keyboard is malfunctioning.If you press 6, it shows 7 on screen,If you press 5, it shows 8 on screen.
  Worst quality Redmi 9 even Redmi 4 is far better than of Redmi 9.Heating problem. Screen fluctuation for some time. After restarting the Redmi9, working.Worst quality ever.Don't buy this product
  No doubt it is a budget phone. Works fineGets Heat when playing online games.Back material is poor and low quality, it could have been better.Very poor camera..
  Good one 🙂🙂🙂 good product 👍👍👍👍
  Best mobile with good battery at low rate. Camera average.Fingerprint sensor working fine.Dont mis it just but(Not for high gaming and photographs)Worth for normal users👍
  Camera quality is very poor. Simply waste. Call volume is also too low. Even too low in loudspeaker . Can't able to hear opponents voice even while talking in calm place. Hate this product. need an refund.
  I upgraded from Redmi6 to Redmi9 with 4GB Ram for better performance. However to find a number, it takes about 25 second or more. It sucks. Xiomi team please suggest a solution immediately or take it back.
  In this price range it's good product.
  Battery life is good but camera quality is very poor
  Please guys don't buy this phone and ye phone soch samaj ke lena ye log return bhi nahi lete Or replace karne ka process bhi bekar hai... Or refund denge ye to sochna bhi mat... Worst experience
  I had to replace motherboard within 15 days of functioning. Of course service center replaced the same without any extra cost but still original is original.
  Did not find any other phone at this price giving 4GB ram and 64Gb storage.
  जो मोबाइल मंगाया वह रेडमी 9 नहीं है ,डब्बा में औऱ कोई समान नहीं हैं  ,  मोबाईल बदलने के लिए आपके यहाँ सम्पर्क किया है मोबाईल की फोटो भेज दिया था अभी तक समस्या का समाधान नही हुआ है किर्पया जल्द समाधान करें
  The mobile is not getting charged since today afternoon..the return window has also closed,what am i supposed to do??i need to get it replaced with a new phone.kindly look into the matter at the earliest.
  This phone is not good spend money 💸 are waste because the phone has hanging problem the processer like helio gtek 12 only I say all is very good but isay Change the processer and add Quallcom Snapdragon
  I think this smartphone is little bit more practical than narzo 20 because it has 4 64 vareint under just 9000 the  drawbacks are ui need lots of improvement and doesn't support fast charging
  I just bought it yesterday and now my headphones are not connecting with the device. This happened within 24 hours of mobile delivery. If you are purchasing it then good luck to you...
  All over it is a good package if you buy it for 7500/- for the price on which I bought it. Peformance is bit laggy and finger print scanner is also not that fast it take 2-3 second to scan print
  I found the front camera is defective. Photos were taken through the front camera are blurs and the quality is so bad. I purchased three mobile previously. But this one is so bad. So Returning it.
  The phone is worth of buying and we can have all features in low price I liked it and suggest to buy this product as it is worth of buying but one disadvantage in redmi phones is it will get heated faster
  This phone battery 🔋 life is better  but camera is quiet bad 👎 I can't support the camera and volume is also  quiet bad but the volume Is not bad that much. Than camera 📷 but gaming experience is good.
  I buyed this phone for my dad considering his nominal use.. But this phone is worst.. Not charging properly.. Charger also faulty..Mobile hangs sometime...Please please dont buy this phone....
  It's nice, but if you're looking for a good camera phone then it's not for you... Overall a nice pick
  Phone is good but accessories incomplete distributor I am not happy distributor sa
  I never expected to receive the worrest mobile iam never trust once the Amazon its my  first mobile orde from the Amazon never order again not replace the mobile still worrest service provided.
  It's a good product cameraquality ,ram,battery and storage was good .I happy about my phone .A little request only need to added back cover,screen guard mostly this two thinks come with product
  Good product but display brightness low
  Disappointing fingerprint senser very slow and performance was very bad by the way this Price range  company Will give value for Money mid range smartphone.
  Better at this price. No issue so far.
  The product is good but it requires 3 hours for full charging....
  Bought it for my office boyLooks goodReasonable pricePictures are after 3 weeks of use
  Had issues with wifi connectivity, network connectivity. Had to exchange twice before returning this for good.
  Best in budget, battery life is good, screen is good
  Budget phone not expect too much...
  The camera really sucked on this one. Although being a budget phone the battery life is pretty good and the look is OK. Definitely recommend if you're on a tight budget. Cheerio✌️
  Never trust on this company . Consumption of data is so much and half of the  internal memory consumed by system apps.
  Powerful phone with powerful battery.
  Good mobile phone with lowest price
  best mobile I had....everything hand-free mode but can not find who connected through hotspot..
  It is an outdated product, No C type charging, display and camera quality is poor enugh. and  bad part is this, we can not return it back to amazon. bad experience.
  I like the brand of smart phone but disliked the features of it.
  Wifi gets disconnected all the time , you have off the wifi and put on again for wifi to work happens every 20 mins.
  this is a value to money product .you can buy this product in a 10%off offer.
  I didn't get any bill with products and this product start troubling now  I went to mi service center they are asking for bill first but I don't have any bill copy not in my gmail or as an hard copy
  Phone will hang, dual SIM not working properly.
  Adopter is not quick charging it took more time as usual. Moreover warranty card and user manual is not enclosed in the box.
  I want change my phone,net speed is very slow coming in this phone
  Nice phone. Recommend to everyone.
  as you all know its best budget phone
  As far as Picture quality is concerned, you can't expect much but battery and functioning is food!!
  Don't buy this product , it offer 5k mAh battery but it doesn't seems like you are using some 2.5k mAh battery phone and camera quality is also not impressive compared other phone's of same price rate.
  I was thin that it will be awesome fone but it does not stand up on my expectations, frount camera quality is not good & battery life is too poor, hardly it's going to single day after the complete charging
  Value for money. Liked the camera and the performance. Quite handly.Con - MI doesn't provide earphones and there is no fast charging
  Camera is not good but except that everything is exceptionally built.
  Camara quality is very poor. I have tried to refund the amount for the purchase of other phone there is no option to refund or replace this phone. I am very disappointed.
  Battery is good. Performance is good.Camera is ok. No notification light. There are few already installed applications which might not be necessary. It does not have MI remote facility.
  Camera quality below then 5MP n battery is drain out in 12 hours...So if you have extra money you should go for it...
  Got it as a gift for my dad.Does what it's says.... I'm happy that Amazon delivers products as promised. Keep it up guys !!!
  Superb Mobile as this price range
  Poor camera quality, bad performance, touch response is slow...at this price worst phone
  Camera quality is very poor its 48 megapixel but picture quality is like 1 mega pixel contact is crashing not syncing with G-mail suddenly the tocrh gets on automaticallyNot good quality product
  The phone is very bad also the performance sucks. I ask the Amazon to refund it but, they said they can only give the same phone. The phone sucks. Also the phone becomes too hot. Too bad don't buy it.
  Very bad , I need replacement of refund , touchscreen and lock unlock screen issue , Internet is not working consistently and WiFi hotspot also not working properly. Speed is also very slow.
  Worst camera quality and don't ever buy product from Amazon as they r only considered about selling their product once their product is sold they r not going to entertain u whether u r satisfied or not.
  Totally waste of money  camara quality very bad this not 12mp lens processer working like a 2gb this mobile prooved china made 😞😞😞😞😞
  Very nice mobile phone for all day use
  "processors" very bad. Was not expected from Redmi. Highly disappointing.Clicked on Amazon app from redmi 9 and my old Motorola phone via 2.5 GHz internet. Redmi 9 takes very long as compared to moto.
  The product is good at this range of price. Camera quality is also okay. Just, the charger pin is not that C-type. It would have been better if it was C-type charger with this Redmi 9 phone.
  Not as I expected realme NARZO 10a 3/32 is best in this range processor is not so fast there is very lag ........
  Can purchase this. This is a great product
  Best phone for mid gamer and for selfie lover it not at much what u want in your photo processor at good level touchscreen response great after 1 month heavy use recommend to if your budget under 10k
  Looks nice,grip is good, batteries also okay, camera is good with daylight condition or using flashlight but it struggles a lot in low light, really like a lot.Well overall it's a good product.
  Umm...I think it's good in that budget..if you're a beginner to android phone you can buy this or the 9prime... although it's good,I recommend this phone to the beginners
  It nice an buy after using one year
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   In box xiaomi says its powered by mediatek helio g35. But inside its helio p35. Very bad you xiaomi. Not expected this
  No fast support and hanging mobile
  Camera quality averageGood battery lifeScreen quality low
  Purchased the item mainly for my child's online class. It is giving excellent service. Useful and economical with very good battery life
  Fingerprint sensor is quite slow that's ok for this price the camera was not much as expected overall the product is good for this price
  Camera is worst. Other all things are good. Battery  and phone performance is good than average. Recommend to purchase if u want phone to use in day to day work.
  Not satisfied with product.
  Budget friendly mobile. Rear camera is not upto the mark. No back cover Or tempered glass with the mobile. Got the product for 7.5k
  The product is defective, it is not working
  Very poor product. Problem in screen bayerry charging jack and screen I got a slow product some shadow also in screen and number are blincking some time. I tried to return but amazon didnnot respond
  Manufacturing defect. But return time is over. What I will do. Old repairing set send by seller. One blue line horizontal arrive in all time. Also net speed is very slow. Please arrange replacement.
  Very bad camera quality. Though RAM is 4GB but performance of Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 is too good (3GB ram). Battery backup is not too good. Very bad picture quality during video call. Not satisfied
  Great Smartphone at this price range. Awesome battery life with fast charging. Very good display colours with a nice build quality. Camera is Also really stunning. At this price range it has no competitors. Just stop thinking and go for it.#Mi,#Redmi9,#Redmi9_iz_lub
  Good product in this price range
  not good  quality, waster of money
  Poor display, poor camera, average processing power. Rest all good.
  Redmi note 9 good phonein this price, but amazon should be less early delivery charges
  Very bad performance . Charging is too slow , only 10% in 1/2 hour. Camera class just broke automatically, and it hangs continuously . And all these has happend in just 25 days .
  Good At this price ...🙏 One more improvement needed is should have c connector but it gives V8/3500 connector overall satisfactory. 😍
  Good but not fulfilled my expectations
  Phone running good. Delivery service very poor phone received after 8th day after book. I'm already Amazon prime members costumer and pay 999 per year.
  Don't buy,camera quality very poor, also asking many permission (allow)When you using that time you feel it was Chinese brandFeatures are goods but not work properlygood battery life
  The phone doesn't have a ADD CALL option.. so we don't have conference option
  Opt for another brand in same price range, rather going with this mobile.
  camera is not up  to the mark at all, if you are buying this mobile for camera don't buy it.... processor is good but not for heavy gaming....otherwise for light use its good deal at this price ...
  Camera quality given was poor. Didn't expect from redmi. Also I'm using redmi 4a which is not equal to redmi9. Seeing redmi 4a camera is superb,  but redmi9 camera is equal to VGA camera.
  Good product with reasonable price
  Decent and average Product not that great and speaker is also not that much loud but provide value for money according to price bought it for 7,649 Rs
  Overall GoodWorking Fine
  1- u can't return this product if u don't like it2- camera quality is too bad3 - display quality is week4-phone is also hang
  I mean the phone is way good for it's budget. Camera quality is also great. Overall a satisfied deal. Look wise also the phone is great. Totally beautfiul display as well. Battery lasts long. No problem faced.
  Once you purchase the item and you don't like the quality at any cost you can not return it. Amazon is not accepting return for the item. The Amazon executive is not talking nicely also.
  Fingerprint response is quickBattery life is goodCamera is like a loop hole to this I wish in upcoming models you'd encounter that as wellGo for it if you want fantastic features
  My product does not support the network, I registered the complaint and Amazon technician scrutinized and informed us they will change the product within 3days.we are waiting to get new one.
  Don't buy thid phone bcz this phone doesn't have compass facility for navigation
  Really good for this segment...
  Its worth the penny you spend.
  Poor battery lifeCamera quality is not up to markBuy it for storage only
  ठीक है कैमरा kuch खास नही है।
  Very bad phone. It's very slow.Dial contact search is very slow, I can't imagine such slowness in 4GB RAM phone.I don't recommend to buy anyone in 9k.Even camera quality is bad.
  This Mobile is best mobile in the world because in this mobile no hang, no lag, best camera quality, best battery, best fingerprint, and i love mobile. Thanks you Amazon for suggest this mobile ❤
  This mobile is quite sufficient for my needs & expectations..
  In this price range the battery backup is good..and camera is decent..all features is Good in this price range ...redmi mobile provide good products in india
  This product fufilles the need of storage space and battery back up however only disadvantage is the camera/ picture quality.
  Display having low Brightness, it's like a basic 4G phone, overall this is enough for 90's kids, 2k kids find a better phone.
  Very slow processor , and it was delivered  without earphone and without back cover, i couldn't find its cover in the market,  so i have got few scratches on the body
  I should not happy for this product, because display many times lighting should be black and no oppression of that time. So, I hope that product should be replaced as early as possible.
  fingerprint sensor not that fastcamera quality is still negoitable keeping in mind the price battery life is quite good...display is moderate....not a good gaming mobile
  Its very bad.. Battery life very less. Camera is bad quality.. I suggest not to buy this phone.  It's waste of money spending on this phone.
  Best phone under 9k
  I am happy with the service of Amazon love you Amazon and this phone is so good there is no heating issue and other problem I am enjoying this phone
  Battery life good,finger print and face unlock is fine only camera is very bad like a old Chinese phone camera no picture clarity ..
  Good slim & stylish phone. Battery backup is very good.
  Go for realme narzo 30A or M11 in this same range. They are much better phones in all aspects.
  Good working... Very well work, screen of this handsent is set is very perfect in this range also for youth.. internal GF also good for gamer...
  Friends dont buy this phone.i lost 9000.but you dont .no Camara clarity.heavy weight.no screen clarity.look like 2010 smart phone.its completely china product not india.iam totaly dull
  Nice phone,battery life good,rear camera picture quality quite good.Good phone in the range of 8 to 9 thousand.I have baught 15 days before and no issue.
  Working well, value for money.
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   My choice was Reminded Note 9 . I selected Redmi 9 by mistake. Voice is better than Redmi Note 7 . Battery is heated during charges mob. Camera is excellent. Battery backup is good. A
  It's a good phone, budget friendly but nly draw back is poor camera quality... Other than that it's fine
  Nothing spl but decent enough for normal use. Good buy for those who wish to keep a use able smartphone.
  Mobile phone automatically getting switched off and switch on making delay, when we got phone third day the problem was happening till now.
  Don't buy . Very bad product. No type c , super old processor, 3rd grade screen. In short super cheap chinese product
  Built quality is some how compromised from previous versions of redmi phone. Still its ok for the price range!
  Product bought us very nice n good quality...Thank Amazon n the seller to deliver the nice product
  This phone is very good only one think that i give it 4 srtar that it contains only one camera instead in his product photo they show that they contain 3 cameras otherwise it's a good product
  Bettry is good but face some serious problemsLow sound incoming callsFront camera not good like other mobile this Renge
  Camera quality is good but features are little less than Samsung m31, super handy, light weight, easy to carry, been using redmi phones since 2014 hence most of the features are same.
  Battery suparebCamra extentDesign amezingLook NiceAll proform superb
  This product is hanging , can't talk one minute continue, on time of talking voice not come properly. And screen is so slow, when dial no and open whatsapp. Sound comes like eco. This is in warranty period. Please take necessary action.
  Nice..big screen phone within good budget
  Very bad quality product. Phone getting disconnected continuously during call. This I experienced after few days of usage after 7 days replacement policy period, so could not able to change it.
  Good phoneGood batteryGood camera.All over good.
  Nice one in low budget..👍🏻
  Using the phone for last 1 month and it has been seamless experience. Specially battery life is good and signal receiving is satisfactory. Worth the money.
  The phone is very hanging, when it's hang the phone doesn't responds, after 30min it'll starts slowly
  Worst camera. Camera quality is simply waste.Display brightness also very worstOtherwise it's good.
  Mobile is too good but 😡 charger is worse when mobile charge till 5 to 10 min. Charger is too hot like  first time i see minimum 10min. It happen very hot like fire🔥🔥 pls replace the charger
  Worst phone guys, always gets hanged and just in one month touch is not working and they do not have proper service center and they deni to take phone under warranty
  Normal basic model ok but camera quality very low battery qualityb1 or 2 days
  Not at all worthfull.  Processor is very slow.  Camera is also not clear.  Not satisfied overall.
  Good job and happy new year’s
  Company cheated and earn money through the sale offer and giving second hand phone at the cost of new one. Very bad experience, think again before buying any Xiaomi products
  If want to use this phone base on camera then don't buy...Doc picture not clear at day light..13 MP Camera just to see but quality like less than 5 MP..Also speaker sound not clear..Others ok.
  Poor battery life first day of usage itself. I charged it 100 percent but in under 5 min drops to 98%.Lack of 5 ghz in wifi is a definite turn off.Of course bad display resolution.
  Dislike hang  mobile Very slow  net Very slow
  Absolute pathetic device and become dead in a week after purchasing and now service center is asking money to change mother board.
  Though it has 13mp camera it does not offer much clarity as compared to the other redmi phones. Apart from that everything is fine
  The product have appears more than one problem after four days use. Speaker quality is very bad and Mike problem is a bigger problem. Mike is not working properly while being called.
  Product is good... Good packaging and on time delivery.... But camera is not at all good... Don't buy just because it has triple cameras... Display n everything is really appreciable
  Mobile back cover is not in the box and offline price are low 8200 rs
  Value for money product. Heating issue while charging
  Amazing product
  The charging wire quality is not good. The wire started melting after 2 days if use and have to buy a new charger out if my pocket.Going 4.5 star for phone but 0 star for charger.
  Dont purchase this product. Replacement is onavailable if there is technical issue otherwise we can't change it , after check the product if you are not satisfied there is no option available
  Nice phone at this budget, no issues found so far especially no heating issue, working smoothly,Good battery lifeCamera quality up to the mark, good as expected
  There is so much problem with this phone. When we call to somebody after 1 miniute it's voice starts buffering and we don't understand what they are saying. I am feeling tired with this phone
  Camera quality is poorSound quality is also very poorI appreciate if you could replace this mobile and provide with a good quality.Thx and get back to me your thought.
  Overall phone is okay as per the Diwali deal, but the camera is pathetic; I don like it anymore.
  Very nice phone with a great battery backup and have fingerprint sensor
  Very slow n video quality is very poor
  The camera quality is bad but overall a good product and Im happy with it's performance
  Very bad, after 3 months, ic and ip damage... (Software problem)
  Mobile looks is nice all the features are good but should improve camera quality
  Good phone for small users
  No C Type chargerNo transparent back coverPoor camera qualityOnly battery performance r best....
  Worst phone to buy Redmi ,Phone got switch off after using mobile just 10 days and  motherboard problm. Didnt get replacement,waiting fr phone repair since last 10 days. Totally dissapponted
  The backpouch was missing in the package, charge cable has drastically reduced it's length. Better Mi should provide longer charger cable. Rest all good with this product.
  Best price for a simple use
  Worst product ever. Worst camera, worst sound and speaker, worst display, just worst. Never buy
  Battery backup is good. Screen size is good. But display is bad. While watching videos on YouTube it's horrible. And also speaker quality is bad
  You can go for it, If you are looking for budget phone

   Camera, battery, fingerprint,toSahi chala tha but phone kharab ho gaya band hai care centre mein service nahin ho raha hai uski Ham bhi nahin ho raha hai display ud gayi hai
  Very good in terms of quality
  ये मोबाइल बजट के हिसाब से सही है  पर यह बिना किसी बड़े एप्लीकेशन डाउनलोड किये ये हैंग होता है बैटरी लाइफ काफी कम है 5000MH सेलेकिन बजट में इससे अच्छा फ़ोन नही मिलेगा।
  इतनी कम कीमत में अच्छा मोबाइल है जिसमे में pubg game खेलता हु ओर hanging प्रॉब्लम नही है और कैमरा भी अच्छा ह सबसे अच्छी बात बैटरी पूरे 2 दिन चलती है चाहे फुल इंटरनेट चलाओ
  Brightness and sounds are the only issue, audio jack is a bit loose, and camera quality is terrible.Rest are gd for the price you paid, and the battery is bomb💥😘.
  Camera quality is below expectation nd avg....there will surely be better options in this range...ppl don't buy this one if the main reason for purchase is camera...plz!!
  The phone is good. Delivered in time. The battery life is good camera quality is also good but only 1 draw back only mi apps which is causing irritating
  Camera quality is very bad. I have not expected poor quality of camera.. I have used redmi 4 before redmi 9 but camera quality is good in redmi 4 than 9
  Camera quality is not that good, fingerprint scanner is excellent and quick, gaming processor with excellent battery 🔋 back-up makes value for money 💰
  Bakwas mobile please don't by this model 1) picture quality is not good2) when contact search mobile is hanging mode3) battery is not good4) I m not Happy with this device
  Processing of every function is very slow. When I am trying to search contact or trying to use any in built function... This mobile is very slow.... I am very disappointed with this product
  Writing this review after 4 months. This phone has touch issues. Touch stops working frequently. Don't go for it. Same problem detected by others who are using this phone
  Overall good performance
  didnt liked the overall finish and feel of the product
  Looks good,  camera is descent, perfect size and can be used using single hand only.Touch is smooth.
  The phone is very good a, battery life I use to play the game all day it takes 10 to 12hours to discharge, it's fingerprint reader is also good but it's camera quality is not good
  Please don't buy this mobile it is worst ever mobile I see low media sound not good camera and it's hanging in just 1 months of buy. Redmi Mobiles are good but this is very worst ever seene
  Best phone at this price
  Excellent phone under 9000 and not suitable for heavy user
  Good quality and product
  Good mobile worthy for rate and product
  Do not buy any MI phone now onwards. Very very very very very very very very Very very very very very very very very POOR POOR.
  Durable phone at this price range. Have bought 3 in the last one year (for office use) and has been working without any issues.
  Ok for this amount, picture quality poor and camera to poor
  Good mobile for that price. Ok
  Only negative is the camera, rest all good
  Very good nice performance
  This product is amazing, it is the best smartphone of India under 9,000 rupees, must buy, it has amazing camera. Good fingerprint reading, charges quick, and long battery life, must buy :)
  I like the product . Very good delivery . Thanks amazon .Camera quality is very good . Battery is superb .
  It's been only 4 months now since I bought this phone and the fingerprint sensor has stopped working. Moreover this phone hangs a lot. Really not happy with this product
  Purchased this phone for my dad. It's good to use. Has got all the necessary features. Don't feel bad about buying budget phone, they get the job done.
  Sound is very low . Camera is bad which I expected
  I purchase from my pocket money saving and i must say that i got full value of money product which gives me super performance#mi
  In Products are many problems many time range problem, sound problem, poor connectivity, communication on call disturbuns, auto lock problem, when use mobile many times lock screen automatically.
  I loved the color of the phone, the camera quality is also good but quality somewhat diminishes when you start zooming it.Battery backup is awesome. It functions smoothly as for now.

  A good budget phone for 4gb/64gb configurationCompact design and promising productSteady and stable mobileLooks like premium phone
  Everything is good except the quality of camera. It does not feel like 13MP camera after taking the pictures. Very much blur images.
  This is very bad phone Sound not coming properly while I walk over the call 1 replace phone with new one but new phone also has same problemThanksSanjeev Kumar
  फोन कॉल के दौरान सेंसर काम नहीं करता जिससे बहुत सारे फोन के फंक्शन चालू हो जाते हैं फिंगरप्रिंट भी सही से काम नहीं करता फोन का वजन भी बहुत ज्यादा है बैटरी बैकअप भी ठीक-ठाक ही है
  Amazing phone in a great price
  Working stop. No quality product
  Camera quality  is equivalent to as of VGA camera. This is a cheating to the buyers by mounting 4 cams showing a big deal is with it.
  The features are good, everything I liked but camera quality is good. Sound quality is good as well as loud also. Over all i like the product
  The mobile works well.
  This phone is not functioning & hanging in last few days. Many times I complaint but anybody till not come to attend. I get the phone in 08.12.2021. Is this your service quality

  The mobile is very bad in condition. It works fine only for a few days. Right from the second month, it starts to hang. The performance and battery life are the worst.
  Battary life is too good  it's running more than two day's so it's very useful I like it'sCamara video Quality Very classThis is the best one of my another mobile
  this phone is very cool this amount and used is very good
  Budget phone with good configuration.
  Battery life is Excellent
  Battery seems to be old, battery cannot back up even for 3 hrs. I think something wrong handling happening in the delivery process. I want to file a complaint in consumer court
  Good except processor

   Before 3 month back we are parchased this phone so me this phone is not working properly so I want to replace the phone or reare the phone.
  Good for online classes,
  Performance is not good there are more frame drops and touch is not sensitive. Battery life is average
  Phone camera quality is not good and phone is hang problem
  best budget phone in its kind. If you have parents that only use whatsapp and youtube then this is the best device to buy for them.
  I am having all these issues in my new phone1)Camera quality is very dull2)i cant install apps from google chrome or file manager3)Having overheat problems and battery drain problem while gaming
  Good phone in less budget...☺️☺️

   There is a dot on the display as soon as we opened the phone. Not sure why the display is bad
  Phone looks good, functions well too.But what discouraged me most is the quality of the camera.  It's not up to the mark.Else the phone is good
  Very nice I am very happy
  Liked the product and quite satisfied after 1 months use..nice for normal day to day usage if your budget is less than 9k.

  I liked the product and it's really awesome
  Recieved faulty phone after retur period the phone got dead. After that mi not given replcament. Within 10 days the phone comes to repair. Hardly used 10 hrs. Totally waste of money.
  Phone was not good & when i request for return from 23 oct started pickiup and still in process they give me date date & date wrost experience i had from amazon not expected
  Camera quality kharab
  From the purchased date, Network Signal was missing always..Couldn't hear voice while attempt anyone's call..Bad or defective item was sold during the festival season..(offers)
  First I have doubt on G35 speed but for normal daily usage it’s performing better than expectedOtherwise all features is good
  Mi remote not available in this model redmi 9 mobile
  I like it and storage,but please don't buy if you are looking for a camera set... It's very poor in camera photo quality📸 , phone is good nice but disappointed with camera
  Fingerprint reader is okaaish.. but battery and camera is disaster.. camera atleast they already told its not hq but battery is i think 3000mAh it does not last even 18 hr.
  Phone is little bit bulky and heavy.. But performance wise it has done good job since 1 month.Camera is decent even in low light.
  Battery life is ok
  Good product in its range.
  Super mobile phone
  A mobile with good ram, good storage and at an affordable price.
  Redmi never disappoints you... Great mobile at this cost.Just buy it...
  Best smartphone in this price range. All the features is available in this smartphone.But not recommended for Heavy Gamer.
  This phone has amazing large 5000 Mah capacity battery .it gives 2 days battery life and also has powerful prosesor#redmi9
  Phone is good for normal use.. Not suitable for high end gaming and camera is normal in day light but not good for night or in dull lights,  and sometimes it get hanged  rare chance
  उत्पाद सही नहीं है मैं इससे बिल्कुल ना खुश हूं क्योंकि जब स्पीकर ऑन करते हैं तो लाउडस्पीकर पर आवाज जन-जन आती है मैं इस प्रोडक्ट को किसी को लेने की सलाह नहीं दूंगा
  Worst Mobile from Redmi cheap quality camera.Bought this mobile price at10k .Please don't buy this mobile,we will get good mobile with this price in other brands.
  It's a good phone under your budget.. No regrets of buying this phone...
  Very slow phone, looking like used oneNot up to the mark, waste of moneyPoor camera quality for both front & backDon't waste your money, go for different.
  Nothing specific to call out which stands out uniquely in this phone. Have been using it for 3 months and pretty satisfied with its performance.
  Worst, Waste of money, product is very cheap as camera is very poor, screen is very bad, don't buy it  , no return and replacement optionas well
  Specifications beyond expectations in this price rangeScreen average.Camera below averageUi excellentReponse time excellent
  Nice As Per Price
  कैमरा अच्छा नहीं है।फ़ोन भी बहुत ज्यादा hang होता है।इतना ज्यादा पैसा और quality बहुत खराब है।
  I received a phone looks brand new but no signals 😝
  If you buy for good battery backup it will be wrong decision for this phone.
  Camera only 13+2MPSelfi 5MPNot happy with cameraNot having C-type charger, not supporting fast changing
  Awesome phone with a great display and camera.this product is awesome.camera is 2/5 battery 4/5perfomance 5/5design 5/5Good product.@Amazon.
  Phone seems to be good in other aspects but camera quality is bad. So better not choose this phone if you are a person who might use phone camera often.
  WORST PHONE.. CAMERA IS WORST.. AMAZON IS NOT ACCEPTING RETURN.. FEELING CHEATED.. THIS MONTH I GOT CHEATED TWICE FROM AMAZON PLATFORM.. AND THEY ARE NOT HELPING
  Not audible.. low sound.. difficult to hear what other people is say.. also while using loudspeaker the volume is too low..
  Very poor quality as well as performance, really my xolo era 4G is better.Really disgusting to see everything including usb cable is made in China
  Worst phone it's hanging a lot it's not even a year buying this phone. Better to go with motorola or any other good smartphone instead of this. So do research before buying Redmi 9
  Very bad camera not suggesting baught any realme phone in this budget atleast camera is good
  Good phone in this price
                    The media could not be loaded.

  Best quality mobile
  Amazing use with the latest product 😊 with limited budget
                    The media could not be loaded.
                
   Only one thing you need to fix..and that is using camera in sunlight brightness adjustment..it will not clear as other phones.
  Bad battery Proformonce 100% to 0 % within half an hour automatically battery drain please replace my phone i am not satisfied this product please help me to replace another phone
  The phoen looks great and design is good and the sporty orange is attractive .The main backdrop in the phone is camera . The camera clarity is very worst and battery life is good.
  There is a sound problem in my phone. I can here properly but other person who talking with me they can't here my voice proper n clear, infact they here their own voice reflection
  Nice mobile
  No suitable big screen. Using and typing problem in one hand.No suitable big screen. Using and typing problem in one hand.
  Product quality is not upto mark. It has low volume plus screen tough is not of good quality. Overall phone is not at 9k rate.
  Price of the product should be less.
  Batteries issue.....
  It's is nice phone under this price, the camera is good, fingerprint is good but the battery life is A bit shorter then expected 5000mAh if you wannna play a game it's not for you
  Got this type of screen within 10 days of use
  Good performance
  I think if the wifi was 5g it would have been icing on the cake my old phone lenovo K5 note had this option but not this phone
  No back cover and headphones was provided with the mobile. A matching cover would increase the positive effect of mobile on a customer by 25%.
  Watch out before buying this phone, they don't have return policy in this product
  Don't buy,camera not quality
  Phone features are bad as compared to new smartphone in the market.. so couldn't buy this phone.. the camera quality is very bad and the charging pin is also old type...

  Phone screen is freezing often, it fixes only when we lock and unlock the phone. It's happening so often which is really irritating. So far no software update to fix this issue.
  इसमें बात करते करते आवाज बदं हो जाती हैं लगा कि नेटवर्क  प्रॉब्लम है अब लगता है की पीस में कुछ प्रॉब्लम है बात करते-करते बंद हो जाता है स्विच ऑफ करने के बाद स्विच ऑन करते हैं तब आवाज आती है इसका का कुछ हो सकता है

  Network and Bluetooth connectivity issues, needs switch to flight mode then data works. Bluetooth connects but only for media not audible while calling. Very poor quality camera

  Don't buy this is mobile very bad quality, screenshot quality Blur very bad, money West, no return policy, bad very bad company, I am sad, no money back not return,
  Everything perfect. Very happy with the product and delivery.  Not a very good camera phone.  All others are great
  थोड़ा पैसा ऑल डालकर किसी और मॉडल को छूने अन्यथा पछताना पड़ेगा
  My father is using it and it seems to be good for him. Not recommended for frequent phone users. Camera is also average but thats what we can expect for this price.
  best phone at this price
  Very good👍
  Performance of the product is good but its front camera feels like 1MP
  The camera Quality is too bad, redmi 7 has better camera than redmi 9.
  For the price, its a great deal. its easy to use and has great battery life

  This is a good buy in the price range for normal household uses. Camera quality is ok. Battery backup is good and other services like fingerprint, display, sound works fine.

  The phone lacks basic connectivity technology and isn't worth buying if you want to use as a primary device.
  The phone is heating, slow and touch response time is not up to the mark.Speaker quality is also poor.

  Awesome product but delivery agents behaviour and customer service peoples give horrible service and delivery agent doest had followed COVID 19 rules
  Its very nice and good smart phone but i cant play bgmi in hd quality, and i don't have a dual screen in it.So, you shoud have change these things in this phone.
  According to the budget, this Android smartphone is quite good and the battery life of this smartphone is also very good as well as its build quality is also the best.
  Everything is fine except the cameraI expected that the quality of pictures should be good enough as it is a three camera phone but all the cameras are worthless
  Worest product .dont buy .even sound clarity of calls is to worest camera worest totaly bad product i am purchased .sorry to say this is fairly said woresr come worest
  It is one of the worst phones.Highly disappointed.Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions.camera bad quality.Touch is not working smoothly.

  Camera quality is normal, OTG Cable not supported
  This is not likely good. This phone doesn't have many features that other redmi phone (below this too) have. Split screen not supported and many many disadvantages.
  I am using this phone for almost three months This mobile is awesome the most things like is the sound quality and back cam quality. I am really satisfied with this
  Apart from display size didn't like anything about this mobile..in this price range or even in lesser price we can get better mobile phones...for example Moto e7...
  The phone was good 👍I thought that the phone back & front cover are also in the item but i didn't get any cover. So iam very disappointed😞 through Amazon shopping
  No type c charger i diappinted
  I mean...u cant get everything at such a price but they could have atleast given 5G bandwidth connection.
  Battery, fingerprint, camera are goodBut in display aline is formed on the right sideI don't know what the reason please contact me for helping
  Good quality and display is average
  Should have better sound and camera
  It has same miui from other other mobiles of redmi still it has lots of problems. Very buggy and very unconventional experience.
  Nice phone !!! Gifted to my mom. Easy to operate !! Her 1st smart phone ! She Learnt very quickly!! Thanks to amazon and manufacturers of phone !
  No screen guard or back cover which are usually available inside the box  nowadays.
  This Device doesn’t support 5G connectivity. Camera quality is very poor.Sound is bit noisy
  Excellent like
  It doesn't support some applications and forces u to use Mi specific applications.It's interface is also not at all user friendly.
  I like the model and camera quality, I like the battery backup but I dont like the hanging problem. The phone is too much over heating and hanging(stuck) too much.
  5star for mobile phone. But no star for packaging. There was no back case. The case's box was empty. The Case's box contains only user manual and sim ejector slot.
  Camera quality is not as much good but in this price range it's quite better and battery backup is good .if you are a very student than it is good recommendation .
  Very bad camera
  Good phone
  Camera quality is low , but battery backup good.
  Display is moderate...overall features satisfactory...battery life strong...somewhat good phone in this budget..like it
  Thank You Amazon
  Good phone, xiaomi is definitely trustworthy
  Lot of Software problems and could expect a better phone in this price range.
  Product is good for price range. 4gb for 9k is a good option. I suggest you to go for this option. Better look and better functions. Good quality to use.
  Worst product, and worst customer service from Amazon.Don't buyInitially they say that, easy return policy but latter on they Deni for return
  Nice product
  Mobile with a good size and higher battery life color is awesome. Full vharging long last upto 2 days. Value for money
  I never thought that the phone coming in the budget would be so good, just the camera quality is a little less, all of which is very good. Battery life is amazing
  I really like this product. This is really good depending upon it's price. If you want a phone within 10k you can definitely go for it.
  Best looking
  Every thing is decent, but an important feature missing I.e. Compass.This is important sensor, please don't omit this sensor in future phones
  Not satisfied
  Mobile 1no bakvas Hai...... Bahot pakate ये log.... Ban kardo is app ko inke pass koi policy available nhi he.... Camera quality to eisi Maine Kabdhi Dekhi hi nhi
  Good Phone
  It will be best but I don't like one thing in that we don't get any cover with inbox and it will be likely heating what can I do please
  All ok but back cover missing...that's not good
  Best mobile phone under 8500
  Well satisfied with this productsensors works fabulousBig screen sizeAnd rest all are also good too.
  This phone is too goodIt's camera is indeginousBattery life is also awesomeThanks for giving
  Very bad product.Colors are very bad and dull.I tried to contact Amazon to replace it but there are no responce.Never buy this product from Amazon
  Its a good budget phone for Normal usage best for simple usage like for house old good battery backup. Camera is average battery backup is good
  Phone body looks cheap camera quality very bad no screen gaurd or cover provided with phone.Now at time of lockdown we cannot find cover.
  Battery and performance is goodCamera quality is low but its ok at its price
  at this price range 4gb ram is  good but they removed some of the the redmi phone featuressuch as1. ir blaster ( remote)2. LED light indication
  Battery backup is so good I prefer this mobile for cheap and best  if you want low price best mobile and this is the one camera quality is better for this budget
  Battery life is good, but camera is below quality. If you buy for a camera, than you have to buy another phone for better camera quality. Fingerprint is average.
  Phone is good for limited usage like age group 30+ because when we use more they phone temperature raise other then that camera quality is ok everything is worth
  Every thing ok bt some problems here , camera is not good it's below average and processor is low and referace rate is also very slow.
  Valuable price for the valuable product
  Good mobile
  Good service
  worth for the price. My you tube channel name is pk gamerx. Checkout
  Basic phone not for multi tasking do only single operation at one time
  With this price and redmi brand, it gives you satisfaction. Go for it, if you are a light user.
  Very good
  Back design impressed🥰Camera 2 starsWorst for gaming it is notBattery betterBut overall go for narzo
  Battery performance is very good long life battery. Camera is decent, fingerprint it's okay. Sometimes mobile little bit lag but okay as per the price.
  Poor performance of processor and camera. Product looks like a plastic toy. No refund is being issued only serviced and that is not to my satisfaction.
  Waste product... Dont buy from AmazonI buy it two times and its fail waste product software issue automatically restarting within 10 seconds waste redmi 9
  I have made a big mistake to purchase this product . It's flash is not working during video call and pen drive is not supported also in this redmi 9 cellphone .
  After few days battery life is reduced & charging time is increased.. but overall good product
  Very poor and low camera , not satisfied after purchase this device
  Not upto mark.. go for note 9
  Very good.
  Bahut achha aaya hai phone
  Camara is not good and upto the mark. Dull looking. Worst mobile in Redmi series. Kindly return the amount. I don't want.this mobile.
  The camera is very bad, and the phone hangs sometimes...Not a very good product to buy... The speaker is very low...
  Nice product
  Nice mobile. Good features

  Very good phone.
  Humble request, please dont buy this phone. Camera quality is very very bad. No return service is available.
  It's 8 month now I m using this product,,,, it's processes is now working smothly,,,, games more then 1 gb is not suitable in this device😏😏
  Battery problems started after just 3month of use,on touch u can feel battery is swollen,no service center is open to claim warranty.Dont Buy
  Great product
  Bad experience with this product I have face prblm of the screen has hang every half hours last two months, I have refresh mobile but problem is not going yet.
  Battery life is good finger print reader is good camara is bad overall performance is okay, for this price range you can look for other brands such as motorola
  Music player doesnot work properly
  got the product and the issue starts after the return window expires.The display starts to scramble and hangs horribly .
  At this price range, it is the best phone.
  All things are average, The main drawback is , whenever I played a song if screen go off, distortion happens to that song. It's a totaly waste for music lover.
  All is okay except the cameras.Camera quality is not up to the mark.
  Value of money
  The camera is like VGA camera, and phone feels very cheap. Do not purchase this phone, this is SCAM.
  Excellent
  excellent
  Neutral..
  Very slow
  Your product is overheating and hanging.And I am not satisfied with your service
  Lower quality phone
  Don't buy this phone. Assembled in China. Very cheap quality. Camera quality is not better than VGA. Very very bad.

  Third class phone.. don’t buy it even if you are getting this in 90% discount .. purchase Made in India items only
  Front camera is not working in new phone i bought it yesterday. And face lock is also not working. I m not satisfied with Amazon's and mi 's service
  Its camera quality is not so much optimized which I don't like personally, Overall good product with 4 GB RAM at this price and performance as well.
  Worst product,battery not charging ayer 15days use,there is no option for return,exchang after 10 days of buying .dont buy...waste of money and time
  If u are trying to make a compromise while buying a phone you can surely buy this phone But if you are a photo addicted person please dont go for this phone.
  Pathetic Camera, absolute blunder can't return after buying..
  After using for 2 weeks, the phone switches off automatically for multiple times while on standby. Amazon will not replace the product after 7 days.
  Battery very good. Camera quality not satisfactory, others features not bad. But i think in this range there are so many phones in online & offline.
  Improve the camera quality and sound quality should also be imoroved
  This phon doesn't has option of creating slow motion vdo
  Looks good.Works smoothly.Camera is average.
  Excellent👍
  Everything is good.. But screen guard and earphone not including. Its ok
  #Redmi9 performance is awesome .. I gifted this phone to my Brother on Birthday..Loved The performance... #Mi is always best phone under budget segment
  Everything is wonderful, except the camera quality.

  Processor was littile slow. Remaining is worth for the amount invested.
  Good budget phone within 10K
  nice mobile received as expected. thank you amazon i recommended this to my collegues too.
  You can buy this phone very nice phone but battery capacity is mentioned as 5000Mah battery. But it looks like 4000MaH battery.
  Mic is not working properly after just one week of use.Useless product.
  Nice good job amzozn tx so much
  Redmi 9 is very good
  The camera quality is the worst. Can't take a proper picture without focus. Even the video quality is so poor. Very unsatisfactory battery performance too.
  Worst phone that I received a damaged one it's start giving trouble to me it's continuesly switch off I can't able use a phone for not even a single minute
  I was expecting a warranty card since it was written in the description that they're providing it in the list of the inside box..but I didn't get that one.
  Value for money cellphone battery is very good fingerprint reader is ok camera quality is average
  Mene Gift diya hai
  Qualifying u r sife in the manufacturers my job. when I new mobile phone in the market quality and price to good. to customer service delivered order best.
  At this budget, it's really ok, good battery backup, back cam was ok for this price,didn't find any lags, its no suitable for gamers otherwise good product
  Good budget phone with such configuration
  Have been using this phone for 3 months. Phone lags often. Camera quality is passable but not impressive. Battery is okay for this range.
  This is the best phone in this budget #mi its battery backup is very impressive and camera #mi is very good as compared to mid budget phones
  I like it's everything such as camera, battery backup,ring, display size, touch screen, ram and rom are sufficient in this prize
  Everything is good in this phone at this price except the camera quality... But at this price range this is perfect phone to buy
  Excellent budget phone
  Good product
  Overall satisfied with the productCan be recommended for starters (new to smartphone)
  Very good phone. Every features in the phone is satisfactory. Amazing.
  Beautiful
  Itne kam me ab bache ki jaan loge...Bhai paisa ke hisab se badhiya hin
  फोन का कैमरा और डिस्प्ले बहुत ही घटिया क्वालिटी का है खरीदने के बाद पछताना पड़ेगा रिटर्न पॉलिसी भी नहीं है बहुत सारे ऐप्स को भी सपोर्ट नहीं करता है
  Good product
  Great phone rough and tough
  Good quality at Resenable rate
  Camera quality is so so.Shud be little better as per the cost.Redt the phone is good
  Camara quality, battery life and fingerprint reader is not Good.
  Good battery, camera is good, build quality is superb.Only disadvantage is the processor. Helio G35 is not ideal for gaming or heavy usage.
  Good battery life
  Product is good but I've not received any GST input.As this is a business account and you are charging GST,you should pass on this to your customer.
  Good phone at this price
  This is the worst model. Very bad performance.  It's seems like old mobile, very very slow. Even Amazon shall ban this cheaper mobile. I hate this mobile.
  Super and outstanding performance
  Had known the specs , but got a phone "Made in China".Understood this would be "made in India".Be cautious if you are specific.
  Excellent product on chep cost 👍
  Mobile camera very good as we investment. Battery is very good in life. Charging is very good. Operating system is not bad. पैसा वसुल मोबाईल फोन.
  Camera photo quality is not good. This does not look alike 13M pixel photo when take from mobile camera
  Nice quality and good performance
  best for it's price
  Good productYour item is good but we are not satisfied with the courier service you have
  Good but camera is not good.
  Great product with this price, features compare to other this range phone are quite good
  कैमरा ज्यादा अच्छा नहीं है फिर भी इसकी कीमत के हिसाब से थोड़ा सही भी है । बैटरी सही है लेकिन फास्ट चार्जिंग नही है चार्ज होने में काफी ज्यादा समय लेता है
  Best Phone i love this this phone also splashproof it tue because i spilled water accidently in this phone but it was still working it was before 2 weeks
  In this mobile I am playing ff it was hanging  when the squad was infront of me it will happen any once  only I will should you refer to take this mobile
  Dont buy. Automatically restarting. Return accepted till 5th November 2020. Problem started from 6th November.
  Value for money product
  Mobile is bit slow... Sometimes just start hanging even you are just watching YouTube. Fingerprint is not working good
  It's a good product for tis rate...And all is good but is not satisfied..Working process it's very good...
  The fone got switched off and never could be switched on.. such a pathetic fone.. i fear its not an original product..
  Very nice
  When I order the product storage was showing in display 64 gb and In this mobile having only 54 gb this is very partial deal I am not satisfied for that.
  While booking they told 3 months prime membership will be free but after booking and receiving order they told no free membership is there fake marketing
  The mobile has decent features, pleasant looks and functioning efficiently. A value for money product.
  I would suggest not to buy as this range has got some screen display issue! Check your screen under sunlight you will find it!
  Nice phone with all the latest technology and app support
  Worst got dead. Camera is worst.. Lock doesn't get open. Spending, 9 k and such quality
  Nice mobile and good looking... good battery backup and Amazon person was very nice to deliver the product I am proud to buy products to Amazon
  Censor is not working properly. Though in call and cliked shutter button, screen is not locked
  रेडमी 9 फोन बहुत अच्छा है इसका लुक बहुत ही अच्छा है इतना कम पैसे में इतना अच्छा फोन 4GB रैम बहुत ही अच्छा है पैसे के मामले में देखा जाए तो बहुत अच्छा है
  Please do  not buy this phone. I bought this phone on Oct 23 2020 and by Nov 17 2020 the software got issue and phone is not working.  Really big scam .
  Worst mobile don't buy this.
  One of the best smartphone in this price Range.
  Worth for Price and Good for Professional Usage
  Sensor bekar hai ph ke..... Khi bhi call kro ge to mobile lock ho jaye ga... On call u can't use your mobile... Plz done purchase.....
  The phone is not up to the mark, callers voice is not audible.we need to talk through speaker at times.camera quality is not very good
  Charging port is type2 which is why battery charging takes more than 6hours to charge from 10% to 100%.Everything else looks ok.
  Good Condition Mobile Thanks Amazon
  Dear team,I am facing problem in the new set. Voice is not clear. Also ringing sound is very slow at full volume. I think it's manufacturing defect. Please do need full
  It's fingerprint reader is not worked. And it's charger is not in working.How can if faith on online purchasing
  Don't waist your money this phone don't work on 5g wifi when u call customer support zero support Amazon better shift to other service
  This mobile was allready used by some one before i brought it's was seacond hand product but i was ordered in bazaj finance so i cant replace the mobile
  It is best in the category of under 10000 of cost good camera but I will say that there are some bugs
  Worth for price..
  Very nice phone in less price . This phone  have nice battery life and fantastic camera.Fast delivery by Amazon
  For some reason the compass in the redmi 9 is not working
  Not good for travellers or bike riders who make use of magnetometer sensor for accurate location traking because it lacks that sensor. Rest working fine.
  All functions are good, But quite big in size. Not handy
  Very nice
  Waste of MoneyCamera quality poorProcessor damn slowShould not opt thisCan get a better mobile adding 1k-2k more
  Within 2 days mobile getting reboot automatic, service center are telling motherboard issue and they are not willing to do in warranty card . Worst service mi
  Since I received Redmi 9, I did not faced any technical or product or hardware related issues.Battery life is also good and functioning properly.
  Mobile charger is too much heat after 5 mint and why the screen lock is doneMeans when we open mobile they ask for password why this is necessary
  Not satisfied with this type of product after 1 week the phone screen is automatic off
  I buy this phone but restart error after replace new phone also same errors. Restart problemVery bed experience for this phone.
  Nice, good delivery
  Liked Fingerprint Reader
  Good phone at this price

  Nice and really worth it.
  Camera quality is very bad but other features are very good

  I had already purchase this phone last year and my experience is good for it better quality and good featured so i orderd another one for family
  It would have been fine, if  it has a metallic back cover . Also if the speaker has much more volume .Altogether worth for money we spent.
  I bought this on 18th oct 2020 and today i.e 12 Nov 2020 it's display become black and not working.And I suggest not to buy this.
  Dream phone for me I love this phone thanku #Redmi9 for this . Having good camera with better lens , bigboss battery & impressed design

  Excellent

  Very nice
  There is no screen split option in the phone so it is my advice to not to purchase this phone
  Touch Screen is not  Functioning Properly Sometimes...i.e Hang...Verry Bad the phone in this price
  Camera is bad quality, charging taking much time
  Phone hangs a lot. Sometimes problem with touch which was resolved after a restart. Not worth buying.
  Took a picture from my phone. Checkout......
  Amount which we have paid it is worthful for the money  , having features like finger print is useful
  If you want a phone, with minimal function and less expectation. This phone is good for you at 8500/-
  Good Android phone with competitive price
  REALY AWESOME.....
  Sound is very less
  Best mobile for budget. No complaints , recieved the product as mentioned.Only thing is with brightness not suitable for sunny day.
