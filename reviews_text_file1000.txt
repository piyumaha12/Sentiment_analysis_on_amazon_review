["\n\n  First of all Thank You Harman for launching an affordable headphone. Now talking about the sound and build quality, the sound quality is awesome if you compare it with other headphone in this price segment. The Bass, Mids and High are equally balance thus giving you a warm and soothing sound. Most Indians like bass so if you are a bass lover you should know that it won't give you over your head bass but you'll get a smooth thumping bass, you can feel the vibration in your ears without any distortion. You get a dual EQ too, normal mode and bass mode. The sound does feel different but not that much. Impressive bass tho with the right EQ settings.If you want a very loud headphone then you won't be satisfied, I was surprised when I could still listen some songs even when both my phone and headphone volume was at 100%. I secretly wish they increase the loudness a little bit more but I'm equally satisfied.Now about the noise cancellation considering it is in the ear headphone and not over the ear it is quite impressive.The call quality is okay. Nothing impressive or nothing bad. The other side can hear me clearly and I too can hear the caller voice clearly.The build quality is normal it is made entirely out of plastic. Plastic material are quite good. Doesn't look or feel fragile.I tried putting this headphone on for 3 hours straight and I must say it is quite comfortable, you get a soft cushions and you shouldn't get any problem in 2 or 2.5 hours of wearing but at 3 or 3.5 hours you might want to rest your ears for a while.Now at this price segment this is the best headphone available. The sound quality beats all the others headphones and yes even boAts headphones. Now about the build quality, there are other headphones better than this but hey, the sound is what important. and this headphone isn't fragile at all plus you get a one year warranty.Well, what are you waiting for, go ahead a buy it. You won't regret afterall it is by HARMAN.#thelongestreview?\n\n", '\n\n  Not liked because his product is made in China so that I am returning\n\n', '\n\n  Would I recommend this product to others? Definitely yes.Pros:Light WeightBattery LifeCons:No 3.5 mm cable, only blue toothI was in search of a light weight wireless headphone that I can use for long hours. I have a Bose now but I cannot use it for longer than 2-3 hours as its heavy and ears and head start aching.This Infinity one wins there. I have used it for 6-7 hours without any aches or pains.The ear pieces do press a little on the ears unlike over-the-ear ones. This one is on-the-ear.  But it is not uncomfortable and gives a good fit.The sound quality is good too. Noise cancellation is not big. With low volumes, you can hear surrounding noise.Battery does last for a long long time. I used it daily for 4-5 hours for about 3 days with one charge. Am truly impressed with it.And it folds, hence carrying it around is convenient too.And I got it in the lightning deal at 1500 Rs. Worth the price. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a non-expensive wireless headphones with a decent sound quality.I am giving it a 4 because I am not sure of its durability. If it lasts foe 6 months at least, then I will come back and update the rating to a 5.\n\n', '\n\n  Hi all,After a week rough usage i am sharing my opinion.i through that under 1499 INR i should not expect the headset with all features except sound,but this one made ,my through wrong.One of the best budget product it is. "Infinity (JBL) Glide 500 Wireless On-Ear Dual EQ Deep Bass Headphones with Mic (Charcoal Black)".Pros:--1.product quality is good on this price.2.sound quality is extraordinary,especially "Gaana website songs" are awesome,prime video streaming sound experience just like a theater.3. Battery backup ~20hrs is good is this product.Cons:--1.aux port not enabled in this version.2.No other reasons here.\n\n', '\n\n  Hello Amazon Team,In the Carton box it is mentioned as Manufactured in USA but in the product it mentioned as China . This is breach case , pls look into & Update.\n\n', "\n\n  I bought this headphone as a replacement for my in-ear headset. I attend lot of office calls due to WFH. I wanted to have a Bluetooth headphone with great battery life and decent mic quality. To be honest, I can't use these headphones for more than a hour, my ears are paining a lot. The cushioning is very poor and cheap quality. Giving two Star, as it is basic sense to design a headphone with proper cushioning for comfort. People who enjoy too much bass can be happy.\n\n", "\n\n  This product is better than its old counterpart i.e. JBL infinity 501. With more upgraded features in an affordable price and under a trusted brand. The most catchy thing is it's 36 mm driver and 72 hours playback time as compared to earlier 20 hrs. playback.\n\n", "\n\n  This is waste of money. Guys Don't go for this headset you will get lot of ear pain and you can't feel any Bass exist in it. Please don't buy it I had purchased later I found such a worst product and returned immediately.\n\n", "\n\n  Highly disappointed and dissatisfied . Can't wear for more than 30 min as it starts to pain , completely against of claims in advertising . Battery backup claimed as 72 hrs ... practically 15 hrs . Cushion on ear cups are not soft enough. Bluetooth disconnected after 7-8 metrs ,  If one scrutinized the reviews well , he can understand that top reviews are paid or Fake .\n\n", "\n\n  I am impressed with sound quality of Infinity glide 510. It's a value product at a reasonable price. My initial impressions.Pros:1. Good sound quality- mids and highs are clear even with a punchy bass.2.Decent build quality at this price.3.Excellent Bluetooth connectivity and range. I am especially impressed with the range.4. Battery life of 72 hrs which is an unbelievable offer at this price.. (I can't comment on battery life now)5.Pretty decent noice cancellation ( not active)Cons:1.The Deep Bass mode is useless, which spoils the sound quality ( It is set in deep bass mode, you can change it to normal mode by long pressing the volume keys together)2. I could feel the pain on the ears after an hour's usage.I am sure, you won't be disappointed with this product. It's quite a catch at this price. Hope it will be durable.\n\n", '\n\n  Its awesome product...thumping base...ears vibrating bass..bery good sound quality and in a affordable pricing...\n\n', "\n\n\n\n\n                    The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0I am amazed at what the Infinity JBL Glide 500 headphone has to offer.Check out the video to learn what I think about it. If you are short on time, read below- Great for listening to songs while workout (I use it daily)- A small footprint makes it look awesome!- Great bass and overall excellent sound quality- Volume increase buttons on headphones seem to be semi-connected to the phone. The volume can go higher than what's shown on the phone.- It connects to the phone in seconds- Great range!- No mute button(con)- Comfortable around neck- Voice quality is decent!If you like my review, do not forget to click the helpful button. It helps me to write and record great content for you guys! Have a great day!\n\n", '\n\n  Enjoy "AWESOME DEEP BASS EXPERIENCE WITH LONG LASTING BATTERY LIFE".Another Excellent product from JBL. I am already using JBL INFINITY GLIDE 500 since 6 months and that itself is having such a good battery backup with a of claim of 22 hours. In one charge it goes for a month or so with an average use of 1 hour. I have bought the product 3 times and gifted them to my brother and friends.With this new model claiming 72 hours backup, it will be just awesome. I have used it for 2 days now and with around 5 hours of use battery level has come down from 80% to 70% only.This is lightweight and more comfortable as compared to its previous Glide 500 version.Coming to its performance... It\'s just awesome for HEAVY BASS crazy people like me.For the best HEAVY BASS EXPERIENCE, please install DI.FM RADIO App from Google Play Store and enjoy few channels like "Russian Club Mix", "Bass & Jackin House". You will definitely love this product.For CLEAR MUSIC EXPERIENCE, you can install RADIO TUNES and enjoy beautiful music from channels like "Mellow Smooth Jazz 🎺", "Smooth Jazz" etc.At this price, it\'s COMPLETELY AWESOME 👌 👌 👌\n\n', '\n\n  Basic functionality of connecting more than 1 device simultaneously via Bluetooth is not available. You have to disconnect from one device so you can connect to other. There are better local brands having this feature. Moreover 40mm driver headset cost same or less than this one, then why should someone buy just because battery lasts for 72 hours. No one listens continuously that long. I am returning this product and so do others if they understand what I mean!!\n\n', '\n\n  First to write the review I guess,Okay, so harman has done a superb job with the glide 500. I bought it as soon as I saw it.These are for for people on a budget looking for a pair of decent looking and decent sounding headphones.I now use it for my daily use.For the price, this is absolutely amazing.It is a plastic build yet not cheap.a nice matte finish texture,with soft cushions, I have used it for almost 2-3 hours straight and doesnt hurt my ears.Also has three buttons( volume and power) a micro usb slot and infinity branding on the headband and the sides.As for sound its a 10/10. Doesnt get distorted on bass, no screeching on treble and nice smooth mids.Smooth criminal you can call it! I have tried house, RnB , Pop, EDM. Can hear all of em suppressed sounds we usually dont hear on cheap headsets.Double tap for Your assistant, quick response and the best part. Deep bass on Pressing volume up and down together.You cant expect the skullcrushing bass, like I said, you get quality bass which doesnt hurt you. Im a Bass head myself, i really love the bass delivered by this beauty because it is well balanced.Battery backup yet to be monitored, playing wellb for around 8 hours now on no charge yet. Sounding well, overall a premium feel.  I had tried boat,boult,ant and those budget ones..Trust me this is the best Hands down.Superb job Harman, keep up the good work!\n\n', '\n\n\n\n\n                    The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0Infinity (JBL)By harmanI m great fan of jbl - HKBut didn’t expect such bad experience from u.Connected to iPhoneSongs getting disturbed as if Bluetooth out of range.  But phone at 1 foot distance. Songs getting interpreted , annoying experience. Connected in android phone too. Same problem.Pls infinity(jbl)(HK)Dnt disappoint by launching lik this product.Bass is good , very clear and no distortion even in higher volume . Looks good , nice foldable compact headphones , fits nicely on ear. Soft cup feels pleasant while listening music.Could have included 3.5 jack port - aux cable can be used in case of battery exhausted.Blue light always flickering once in 5 sec , disturbing in night - which is not required to flicker.\n\n', '\n\n  connectivity - goodcomfort level - goodcall quality - goodmusic quality - below averageeven on flac format song i miss the expected average music quality than samsung level u....\n\n', "\n\n  Using this infinity headphone for the past 1 week and here is the brief review:# Pros:1. Excellent bass, delight to listen music on this headset.2. Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity is top notch..It's connects very quick after pairing.3. Handset Muff's are decently soft.4. Very less external sound creep in when u r listening on minimal volume. In higher volumes, u can't figure that.5. JBL quality sound. Minimal sound distortion in higher volume. 2 different base for unique listening. Very good value for basic listeners..6. Easily adjustable headset leaf so that it can be fitted tightly according to ur head size.# Cons:1. Build quality is basic. Its more of plasticky and looks normal. The turning hinges looks fragile. Till now, no problems faced, will update it long term review.2. Power on/off becomes a tricky function..It take more than 2 sec to power on/off..During power on, it starts syncing for new Bluetooth devices due to the prolonged time.3. Call voice quality is normal. The voice is very low heated from the other end.Apart from the above, the headset is value buy and its one of the excellent, branded headphone choice in the current market.\n\n", '\n\n  When there are thousands of headsets in the market including the cheap Chinese ones, I wanted to go for an option from top brands within my budget. Harman being a reputed brand I shortlisted this as my budget was low and purpose was for indoor use only. I am very happy with the call quality (It is at par with my Bose NC headset when you compare indoor performance) I am not a pro so could not find anything wrong with music quality. The range is good as it is Bluetooth 5.0. Lastly the comfort level is good because it is light weight.\n\n', '\n\n  I bought as many people said its plastic, but premium. But, its not. Its a very cheap plastic.Sound is very hollow. No punch, or clarity. High and Mid are very dim, bass is ok ok. With the bass boost option, sound is Ok, else its very hollow sounding.For this price of 1499 or cheaper, Boat is way better in both build quality and sound quality.Wont recommend.\n\n', "\n\n  1#Actually its hell of a product I have been using for quite long and this is what I feel about it:Pros-1.Battery -It has a long lasting battery as about 72hrs( as company claims) but I am sure no one using it for continuous 72hrs but what I felt is that when I unboxed the product it was 80% and after 3 days of regular usage like music,youtube,movies I was able to make 3 days with 50%remaining i.e 30% for 3 days and it took me about 45 min to chagre it up to 80%2.Sound quality and bass-This thing is a beast regarding bass and sound quality I can asure you that this wont even dissappoint you in case of sound quality and for bass,if you bass lover like me it got 2 mode-normal and deep bass.If you cant feel enough bass at normal mode you can easily shift to deep bass mode by pressing +and -button together then you will feel an astonishing bass effect even you can feel the headphone starts vibration at each beat and if this doesnt make you enough then I recommend you to meet an E.N.T for check-up Dude belive me it's crazy3.Bluetooth range-Its just great because its version 5.0 and provide greater range even after crossing 3 rooms you can get adequate range without breaking any signal4.Microphone-its like a bonus because it has good audio recording but the only problem is that it works only during calling i.e you can use it to record or send voice message in whatsapp5.Usage of buttons is just as simple as it seemsLets get to cons:(Only two minor ones)1.comfort-Actually it is only one negative thing I felt about the device after my first usage .It is a bit uncomfortable to wear and you will feel a slight pain over your pinna (external ear )after using for 1 hr ,but now I became adjust to it now I can wear it for hrs without any problem belive me,it can take some time to adjust and after that you won't feel any problem plus it's is weight less and small device so you will easily adjust within one day2.Plastic quality-(It is my feeling that )it seems to be a little fragile during transport especially keeping it in a bag so beware of thatOther than these 2 minor factor I never felt anything bad about this device.So my verdict is that I usually loves to hear music with a good bass and effect and I have used many device from Sennheiser,Ant audio,Jbl,Boat,Skullcandy,Audio technica,Sony and many more so from my experience I will recommend this device to many and I would say THIS IS THE BEST HEADPHONE IN THE MARKET THAT PROVIDE BLUETOOTH AND SOUND QUALITY AT THIS REASONABLE PRICE POINT IF YOU ARE GONNA BUY A HEADPHONE UNDER 1000 JUST PUSH YOUR MAXIMUM TO THIS PRICE POINT IT WILL ALWAYS BE WORTHY.A GOOD PRODUCT FROM HARMAN AUDIO /JBL AS ALWAYS#But all these good factors vanishes because of the horrible comfort that is why I gave 4 star.Otherthan comfort this is awesome\n\n", "\n\n  I absolutely hated it from the moment I started using it. It feels so cheap. Even though I was sitting right in front of my laptop it got disconnected multiple times. My ears started to get hot after some time. I'm trying to return it but apparently I can only replace it. DO NOT BUY THIS!! IT IS A SCAM ! U CAN'T GET A REFUND! THEY WILL send u the same thin again!\n\n", "\n\n  Pls don't purchase it. It has a sound in right side of headphone. Harman group had told me to send this product. I had parcelled this which cost me around Rs 400. Now they have returned the item again to me without any notice. And when I called, they are saying there is no fault. Such a poor customer service.Sincere request, don't purchase it. It has a prominent sound like vibrating string. Add to this such a poor customer care. Their behaviour is shameless. They should learn from Amazon.Update on 20.nov.19: Customer service of Harman group are shameless. I had some recordings. Everytime they will say we will call you back after 24 hours. But they will never call. I am going to file a case in consumer court.Its not a good headphone at all. Pls purchase other item. Forget about customer care, sound quality is not good. There is a Continous belling soung.Thank you\n\n", "\n\n  SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD, BUT THE HEADPHONES ARE TIGHT AND MAY GIVE YOU PAIN ON LONG USAGE. I have not been able to use it for long time since it's too tight for me... And Irony is Amazon doesn't want give refund to me. I want to go for in-ewr headphones but still they don't want to give the refund. And cherry on cake is Customer care shouts on the customer... @Amazon you need to train your customer care people. Ridiculous experience. Please give my money back if you can so I can have another headphones.Update: Amazon gave my money back, and i was able to buy another headphones.

Everything was going well. Exactly after 1 week, which is 21st sep I used the headphone for 3 hrs to attend some meeting and as soon as I disconnected it the headphones stopped working.  I went to the phone shop they said they won't repair this. I wrote a complain at Harman website they had no response.. please Amazon  have a look at this product and I will wait for the reply.Regards\n\n", '\n\n  Superb clarity. Bass in normal mode is enough, no need to change the EQ setting. Highs are little less bright but still comprehensible. Vocals sometimes feel muddy but looking at the price range, there cannot be better headphones. This is top notch quality in this price. Far better than Boat, far far better. No comparison, in fact. JBL is JBL.\n\n', "\n\n  It worked fine for first 2 weeks, It's now less than 15 days and it stopped working.Not sure if It charges properly... I can see the red light while charging. Then click and hold power button to start - power button seems to be not working.Is there any reset button to auto fix settings?It's useless now. I can't return it as after 10 days as per return policy. I have 1 year warranty. I don't know how to claim that.It's not a good experience.\n\n", '\n\n  I purchased this on 28 August, it was delivered on 31 August. The delivery was good. Now to the headphones,this headphones has all the things you need to called this headphone. I mean the sound quality is excellent. Bass is good. No distortion in taking calls and decent build quality. It kinda look like jbl t460bt younger brother. I have given 4* because it has a minor issue of producing a sound like "ting ting" when you touch or tap right side of the headphones. But it doesn\'t bother that much so it\'s a sweet deal. Hope you can enjoy this product.Update: 27 may 2020- I have been using this for past 8 months and their sound quality is best considering it\'s battery life and build which is far good than other headphones available. The only one drawback is their are not much comfortable. So if you can compromise a bit then go for it.\n\n', '\n\n  The build and sound quality of this thing is awesome. I upgraded to this after my Sennheiser cx 180 street ii broke. For all those who are wondering it comes with a 610 mah battery. I am by no way a audiophile but the sound i feel is excellent. It was by default in bass boosted mode and i switched it back to normal. Battery life, Durability all those things will be updated in a future update. I feel it was a bit uncomfortable for large head, mine is xl 😝 but not that troublesome (3/5 for comfort). Edit : The sound of the headphone is excellent after burning in for more than 10 hours. You get used to the headphones after sometime. So yeah its more comfortable now. 2 days of 3 hour per day use in medium volume gets battery down by 10%. Buy this thing eyes closed.\n\n', "\n\n  This is made in China product (written on the box). It's showing it's nature from first day. If sound is not played for 3-4 min and then you play any sound the headphones will not respond until you until you pair it again. I don't know if it is happening with me only. In one hour I noticed 3-4 time sound stopped for like half sec which I did not expected from JBL, me and my phone were on same bed .Sound is nice but breaking half sec between songs is not acceptable. Bad bluetooth connection.I literally search JBL is US brand but still they have quility like Chinese products.\n\n", '\n\n  Mind Blowing 3D surround sound Experience, I have sennheiser and Sony headphone but really this headphone is amazing, every notes and vocal r clear and bass is very very very awesome when u r switched in powerful bass such u feel with new bass experience. Overall I give full rate 5/5\n\n', "\n\n  Here is my detailed review of this product after a week of usage:1. Build quality:Earlier was sceptical a bit about on-ear headphone that the outer ear will pain after long use. But this one comes with great built, comfort, lightweight and handy that one can use for longer period without any discomfort.2. Sound quality:I'm an audiophile. Love to hear every single frequency from low to high and set my theatre for the same. Here comes the sound of this product it'll really produce the low frequency approx 80-100hz which is really good for such small speaker resulting good bass, clear sound with balanced trable.Noise cancellation is as expected. You'll be cut out from outer world.3. Bluetooth control and battery:Bluetooth is working as expected and can be achieved at a distance of 10-15 mtrs. Control buttons are good with proper sensitivity battery lasted 18 hours of regular use.Over all a nice product from Herman and can buy without having second thoughts.\n\n", '\n\n  This is my first Bluetooth Overhead headphone.Reason why I do not prefer Bluetooth headphone is due to its poor battery backup and sound quality, I always prefer Wired headphones also for its sound quality.But this headphone is a game changer1. Battery Backup: this headphone is really great in the battery backup. I was an average listener and game player. So it was giving a backup for more than a week easily for me. I never thought of charging it from the day I bought it.2. Sound effect: The sound is absolutely good with some equaliser and it’s best with power amp, and some music player which has custom equaliser in Android. If you are iPhone user and wanna enjoy music in default music player , then it’s not for you. However we can install some third party music player with equaliser and enjoy the music (eg: onkyo player).And the best part of the headphones is enjoying a movie with deep bass mode. If you are looking for a headphone to enjoy movies for long time with best bass boosted high volume sound effect then go for this without thinking. I really enjoy watching Marvel collections since I’m marvel fan. Oven never enjoyed such a deep bass anywhere. Even in laptop the movies sounds great with VLC media player(subjected to best equaliser settings).3. Comfort: The headphone gives a great comfortable tight fit. I’m a big head guy and it’s really so hard. I can’t wear it for more than 20 min. But I gave the same headphone to my brother and sister, everyone is comfortable wearing for so long. So I wear it in a different angle and it helps me to fit comfort. This is definitely for round headed people, it has a huge extension but still there is no adjustment for horizontal flexible adjust fit.4. Build Quality: So good and sturdy. Light weight and foldable.5. Noise Cancellation: It gives a nice noise cancelling sound environment with more than average volume level. Compression is perfect for normal head. Since I have round and huge head, it is not giving perfect closure to ears if I extend the length of the adjustment. That’s the only problem for me. Never mind if you are normal headed.Mic: During call and gameplay I never had a complaint from other end. They can hear my voice clearly.Drawbacks: It does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack and I can’t enjoy the Dolby Atmos effect from my laptop. For this extreme bass headphone if it gives me option to connect and enjoy the music I would be so happy. But it can’t be bundles with all futures right. That’s negligible for me.Overall it’s a Best Buy for the price range. I really enjoy it and my family is enjoying with this headphone.Thanks\n\n', "\n\n  I wasn't able play pubg connecting with this headset, you will get the fire sound or foot sound with delay of 2 seconds so you can't sync the sound of game which you hear in headset and game play.\n\n", '\n\n  Sound is good but will only work with mobileNot with laptop or anyother device\n\n', '\n\n  Infinity Glide 500 is very accurate in terms of sound quality. Build quality seems to be not so good because all is plastic. I was comparing this with Jbl T460 bluetooth headphone. The INFINITY GLIDE 500 is having puncy bass. I could say that bass is little bit overpowering...there is option to switch ON the deep base mode but believe me friends I could never feel the need to enable deep base mode. The bass is too much even in normal mode. So bass lovers will like this headphone for sure. Please allow some time to burn the headphone to produce quality sound. First day you may not feel the headphone good but believe me from second day I was just in love with this as it produces sharp details. So burning time is required to free up the components of headphone. Battery backup is tremendous...as compared to Jbl T460. Jbl T460 has just 11 hours whereas this headphone has 20 hours backup. Price is also very low.Thanks.UPDATE AFTER USING 3 WEEKS:This headphone has really became my travel mate...This has bluetooth 5.0 and it does not even disconnects in Mumbai crowded local trains. Your phone should support bluetooth version 5.0 and it will connect with this headset seamlessly. Lower bluetooth versions are also supported of course...But 5.0 is great for connectivity and battery optimization.EQ mode is not that great and it does not give any difference and there is really no need to push for deep base....it is just awesome in normal mode....Flexible to carry and travel...Great headphones.\n\n', '\n\n  I was expected a lot from this Bluetooth headset, but disappointed very much.It like a normal piece, not worth to buy for Rs1700\n\n', '\n\n  Today, I have received Glide 500 wireless on-ear headphone. But the product is not as good as I have heard abt it. I purchased it for brand name HARMAN but sound quality especially Bluetooth connectivity is so irritating that I prefer to return this. I played music on ganna app as well as songs available in my phone but same problem exist both the time. Every 4-5 seconds a interruption occurred and sound became low. So I recommend not to buy this.\n\n', "\n\n  This is a good head set with very good connectivity, call quality, recharge and playback time. The only thing I did not like is the missing high frequency notes, poor sound stage. The sound is not flat but heavy in the mid range. Anyways I won't expect much from a product at this price point and won't matter much to me as I wanted to buy this for hands free office calls during this COVID-19 lockdown which this is good at. I have other audiophile grade earphones to satisfy my music needs. I will give this a 3 star.\n\n", "\n\n  Pros1)The headphone sound quality is good and the Mic is excellent (as compared to mic  of evn headphones with higher  prices )2) the range of the bluetooth is also quite nice .3) the battery charges fully in less than 2 hrs.4) the battery life is more than 15 hrs which is sufficient5) the quality of plastic is good  and is flexible but there is no padding on the top6) the headphones are foldable ( easy to carry)Cons1) the cushions on cups are not comoftable for long duration as the headphones are little tight .2) no Aux cable support  ( no 3.5 mm jack)3) when battery is below 20 % it will keep bugging you with 'battery low' sound4 ) you can't use headphones while they are charging.\n\n", "\n\n  Cons:1. Aux support is not there.2. Only a single device can be connected at a single time. That seems a lack very often.3. Sound of headphones isn't pleasant. Though bass of headphones pretty good, but I didn't liked the audio that I expected as a JBL cousin brand.4. Design is poor, no cushions over head makes it look cheaper.5. Wiring can be seen easily on backside of headrest. I don't know for how long it will be stuck there.6. Thought they mentioned 20 hr backup, It doens't seems to me. I don't know on what volume they mentioned 20 hr playback. But it lasts longly.Pros: Money vise you can stick to it, but if you can spent a little more, go with JBL itself. The quality and style JBL can give, infinity couldn't.\n\n", '\n\n  Amazing product as I expected1. Sound quality is really poor in this budget. Volume level is sufficient enough and easily adjusted by buttons.2. Appearance  is Very nice and doesn’t look like cheap.3. Very comfortable but its little tight so difficult to wear after 1 hour. Ears start paining after some time.4. I observed very clear voice during call. Mic is also of good quality and performs well.5. I will observe its battery backup and write more about it.Got in 1580₹ so its a good deal.The product doesn’t look like an original one\n\n', '\n\n  Heres my initial experience...(as a professional video editor and avid video watcher)HEAVY AUDIO LAG : If your using this for music only, then you wont notice this. But like me if your buying this for video watching then this will be totally unusable. The transmission has a heavy delay. Voices will seem out of sync. Car doors closing sounds come after the door is closed. This is happening on YouTube and even Local movie files stored on the PC in all formats. Even tried with different players. Different devices such as phone, PC, Laptop.CHEAP TIN PLATE NOISE : Theres a sound of a tin plate doing a "tatung" noise each time you press any button on the headphone. As if theres a cheap tin sheet inside. At least if this noise comes only when pressing buttons its ok, we can adjust with it, BUT the noise comes even if you shake your head. Even with the headphone OFF. Theres some cheap material used inside that\'s causing mechanical vibration and is loose. This seems like not for only my unit, bec many members here complain of that noise. Also this "tuuuunnng"  noise will appear even when you stop a video. Say someone on the video is talking and you just hit pause. Immediately after the sound stops you will hear the excess vibration noise, that means its vibrating throughout the video marring the sound quality slightly, only thing you dont notice its contribution except for when you stop the video you hear that its been vibrating all along. With the headphone OFF put it on your head and just loudly say HEY or AAAH. You will hear the followup whining "tuuuuuung" noise. WTF is this quality ? Shame on JBL and HARMON KARDON. Sound quality is one thing, you get what you pay for, but these are severe cripple/blunders which are not acceptable. A maruti cannot give you the quality of a mercedez benz, accepted. But just bec its a maruti if one wheel is missing then thats a major blunder, not quality, yes theres a difference.HIGHLY ILLOGICAL ERGONOMIC BUTTON PLACEMENT : But this issue is also manageable compared to the above mentioned problems. The power button and volume buttons etc were placed by the genius designer on the angled side. You cannot find them or press them easily without some finger flexing. Try n see. If you try to press the VOL buttons when it on your head the headphone will come off your head, because the button is on the side, when you push the whole cup will move off your ear. But this problem can be over come by practicing to operate with 1 other finger holding the opposite side for support to give counter support when pressing a button. But if trying to change to Deep Bass mode when its on your head ,,,,good luck trying. Even the LED was placed at such a position that you\'ll only need to hold it in your hand to see what status its blinking at, good for pairing maybe. If it was a little on the front when your wearing it, then you could easily tell by the refection in the monitor or by watching any reflective surface in your room that its active etc...but this is negligible and not a real problem.CONNECTIVITY : Very fast to connect and auto connect.RANGE : Its doesn\'t work for 20 meters and all that crap that you keep hearing around. Its like standard BT range, Within 1 room or just outside that room door. That\'s about it.FINAL VERDICT : I would love to return this (or throw it at the manufacturer\'s face if it were possible), but its inconvenient because due to COVID i ordered this to ship to a relatives zone, drove there and collected it (75km drive total). Now ill have to again go and give it there, trouble them to handle the returns guy, then again drive down there when a replacement comes, that too not knowing whether that replacement will solve the problem or have the same issues. My car fuel costs more than the headphones to do 2 more drives for 75km. I might as well use this a while and throw in the bin (where it belongs) and buy some other brand in the future.\n\n', '\n\n  The headphone is not of the quality which I expected.Some common problems which I’m facing are:1. The company claims to provide 20 hours battery life but it only provides about 10 hours of battery life while listening at 60% volume level.2. It stops charging and I need to remove the charging cable and then again put it inside so as to resume the charging.3. Sometimes the headphone doesn’t power on when I press and hold the power button. After 2 to 3 attempts it gets turned on.\n\n', '\n\n  By the name brand of Harman expected exceptional sound quality but the sound quality is just ok and is equivalent to some low quality brand headphones which are availablenat cheaper price than this.At higher volume 70% onwards the sound starts bursting.\n\n', '\n\n  Bought this product on the launch day, with lot of expectations , and found the brand new Infinity without the mic working. I had to return the product.Sound quality seemed okay for the price and light weight plastic body.Overall Verdict for a new launch 2/5, as there was no QA put on to the product whatsoever.\n\n', '\n\n  First day review. I bought this for phone calls, and audible. The sound quality on the other side in calls was muffled. For news and audible the sound quality was good, not great. One immediate effect was a dulling headache on wearing this headphone that started right after wearing it and left you the moment you put it away. However, I ignored it and went on for about a half hour. The headache is very discernable and lingers after you put it off. I dont know if it is the bluetooth or high battery capacity or what, but headache for me was a wild card factor that I had never figured. I do not have a headache, ever.\n\n', '\n\n  Good product\n\n', '\n\n  Connectivity is good with Bluetooth 5.0.Sound quality and clarity is good for the price range.Bass is good with Bass mode On.Not good for long time use, it is creating ear pain after using it for an hour or more. But thats same with most of these types of headsets.Noise cancellation is good.\n\n', '\n\n  Sound quality is good but causes pain in the ears. uncomfortable to wear\n\n', "\n\n  I bought this to listen to music as well as attend office meetings through my phone. While I was attending webex meeting from phone, I got a phone call. I declined the call as I was supposed to be in the meeting. After I declined the call, I couldn't hear people talking in webex nor people on the other side could hear me.After further testing, I could figure out some more flaws with this.Trial 1: Switched on the Bluetooth in my phone and then switched on the headphone. Headphone got connected to my mobile. Made a call, everything works.Trial 2: Switched on Bluetooth in my mobile. Made a call to my friend. Now I switched on the headphone. Headphone connects to mobile, but neither I can hear my friend's voice nor my friend can hear my voice.There seems to be many problems in the software. Luckily I figured out the issues within 3 days after purchase. I just returned the headphone.\n\n", '\n\n  The quality of the product is very low and there is a weird sound coming from the earpiece like a guitar string coming constantly whenever i speak or someone else speaks\n\n', "\n\n  Good headphones. You get 20 hours of playback at an exceptional price. Sound output is very good, way better than Sony ZX 110. I am also using Sennheiser CX 180. Although sound quality cannot be compared to Sennheiser, but still everything is crisp and clear. No glitches whatsoever.Build quality and finishing is top notch. The sample photos posted on website are not doing justice to the real product. When i received these headphones, i was stunned. Its completely jet black having a nice circular glossy finish on the earpads. The infinity logo is also big, pronounced and looking quite sober. These are lightweight headphones. Pads are neither too soft nor too hard.Bass is pretty decent in normal mode. When i have to listen to alternative rock, progressive, bollywood and punjabi music i use the deep bass mode. It makes you feel as if you're enjoying music in the comfort of your car. Feels as if it has its own mini basstube, which is great addition to a budget headphone like this one.Fitting is good, you get a good snug fit. When i was using normal bass mode it was comfortable, not so much using deep bass mode. Kind of warms up the ears but once you get used to it, it's comfortable. Keep it at adequate volume level.Conclusion - Audio-4/5, Bass quality- 5/5 Build Quality - 4.5/5, Comfort-4/5, Battery Backup-5/5, Value for money-5/5This is a good start i feel. After using these you can upgrade to premium ones later on. Good quality headphone padding alone costs quite a bit, therefore making a good quality headphone within this 1400- 1500rs. price tag is a commendable work. These are by Harman Kardon and they justify each and every single penny you spent on it.If my review has helped you, click helpful button. Have a great day.\n\n", "\n\n  There's some serious design flaw in the manufacturing bof this headphone. Folding and unfolding puts abnormally high strain on the wires running from Right ear cup to Left earcup. I had originally bought this headphone in september 2020. It stopped working from one side in a couole of weeks and by December 2020, it stopped working altogether. I managed to claim the warrenty and recieved a replacement unit. The replacement unit died in a similar fashion by April 2021. I was deeply annoyed and opened it up to see what was wrong. Turns out the wires connecting the speakers to the control board are the kind you'd find in cheap wired earphones- they don't have a proper insulation sheathing on them. The individual fibres are coated in some very fragile insulation and eventually due to normal rubbing of wire between the plastic case in its route, the insulation was sure to wear down and cause short circuit between the ground and signal wires for the speakers.Poor design choice by JBL.The same issue was experienced by 2 of my friends. And it's not like we're folding it everyday amd carrying it in backpocket- No, the Headphone did not hold up in normal usage.Other then that the earphone's Build quality is mediocre in general. It's a full plastic build and it starts making sqeeky noices in just a days when you strech it over your head.Sound quality was good though. Decent amount of base, pretty loud, clear highs, moderately clear mids. Considering the price range, 5 stars for sound quality. But what use is sound quality if you can't use it properly for even a couple of months.I'm really disappointed.\n\n", "\n\n  Kindly read this review if you're planning to buy this product.I was looking for good quality Bluetooth headphones and that's when I reached here.Quality-*It comes in good packaging.*The overall quality feels good considering the price.*It looks premium.Comfort-*If you keep listening for more than an hour, your ears will start sweating.*The earpads are not very big like the premium headphones.*Doesn't feel discomfort while wearing.Sound Quality-*Its crisp and loud.*Even at high volumes there is no distortion, which is great.*Don't expect any noise cancellation from these headphones as they are minimal.*Bass, mids lows, etc are balanced.Verdict-If you're looking for good quality Bluetooth headphones, go ahead order it.Happy Shopping\n\n", '\n\n  In this budget range the sound quality of head phone is superb.Today itself I received the product, let see while using a week for performance.\n\n', '\n\n  Nice product. Clear sound. Battery backup is awesome.Good bass not todu.Built is light weightMedium in sizeFeels premium.Comes with usb charging cable.Volume buttons are ok not a good quality buttons.Easy to connect.Overall with this price you will not feel looted with amazing battery backup.Feeling good to buy this.\n\n', "\n\n  built quality is good, though looks plastic. speaker output is better. but after an hour of usage, your ears may feel uncomfort, as ear cups are not that much ok. slightly your ears starts paining. not smooth enough. noise cancellation is ok. it can be improved.Never use fast charging adaptor to charge this headset. Please make a note of it, as it may damage your headset.But at this price point, this headset is excellent.Normal listeners cannot differentiate the sound effect between 'Normal' mode and 'Base' mode, but those functional keys (+ / -) serves the purpose.Noise cancellation is poor. Simply closing the ear lobes with ear sponge is not noise cancellation.... If you mermer with headset, your own voice will sound loud.\n\n", '\n\n  A quality product from Harman and JBL. It gives you the feel of every beat. On the design front, they are definitely less fancy than Boat but the quality across the two is unparalleled. I own Boat Rockerz 400 and Its a decent product but it is unbearable for a long period of time. Comparatively, JBL is more comfortable on the ears. They are light and plastic quality is good. However, they are not flexible like Boat and seem a little delicate in comparison. Bass and music experience is positive. There is not much noise cancellation and to be fair it does not make any noise cancellation claims either. Battery backup is definitely good and no issues with charging. Boat vs JBL is a tough call. However, Boat has a 3.5 mm jack and this does not. It is very useful esp when wifi is not strong as Bluetooth can interfere with 2.5 GHz wifi. My current focus is to buy Non-Chinese products and I wish to be "Vocal for Local" but unfortunately, there are not many Non-Chinese alternatives available. Even Boat is "Made in China" and so is this. I hope Modiji will remain committed to his words and we\'ll soon be buying "Made in India" products.\n\n', "\n\n  The product carries a warranty that is completely worthless. Within 3 months of use, the unit malfunctioned, and we asked for repair/replacement as per the warranty. In spite dozens of calls and complying with every one of their strange - telephonic, never written - demands, such as breaking the unit into 2 parts and sending them pictures, which risked my being later accused of causing 'physical damage that would void their warranty'  they only kept giving excuses and NEVER honoured their warranty. Don't trust them. Unfortunately few of us have time to drag them through the courts, and they know that very well.\n\n", '\n\n  The Sound Quality for the price is unbelievable. An attribute of most headphones would be it’s unmissable heavy-handed Bass. That seems to be better modulated, the vocals and mids are clear.The treble is how I like it(checked with a few black metal songs).Not sure how long it’ll work properly given the rate. It’s a steal that’s for sure.\n\n', "\n\n  Writting after 4-5 months of daily use. The main USP of this headset is Battery and Connectivity. It does last for said 72 hrs, or more than that. Once charged it easily lasts me for 10+ days. It's better than it's competition on sound and build. It is durable. You may find reviews about complaints for discomfort on ears due to continued usage, but guys, there's no headphone in this price range which is comfortable for 30+ mins, this is better for 1 hr.\n\n", "\n\n  Sound quality is below average.Noise cancellation is just ok.Forget about comfort.No comfort at all. Cushions is not soft.Too tight to wear even for 20 minutes.No head cushion.Quality of Plastic feels cheap.Connectivity is good.This heaphone is strictly made for bass lovers.Bass is just boosted, vocals are not clear.However sound doesn't get distorted at high volume.Personally I had purchased this watching online lecture and listening some music.Which it doesn't yeald the purpose.Only and only usefull for listen bass music, while feeling uncomfortable.I would have returned this, it but their is not return policy.\n\n", "\n\n  This bluetooth headset is awesome in sound at this range I.e. Rs 1499. My pros and cons about this headset are as below:Pros:1.No doubt in quality of sound. Good clarity.2.The sound rolls on.3.The bass is thumping even without Bass mode. There is very little difference between bass and non bass mode.4. Good Bluetooth connection5. Good Battery life , till my 3 weeks of usage, goes at least 10 hours in max volumes.  I give full charge for about 2 hours, and goes for 3-4 days by using discretely 2-3 hours daily.6. Doesn't pain on ear as such. Quite comfortable compared to other on-ear headsets because of it's light weight.7. Price is low at this range.8. All functionalities of buttons work well as described in the manual.Cons:1. On the left side of the headset, where buttons are present, makes some noise when u beat little with finger or touch the keys, like 'Ting-Ting' which is quite annoying.2. Not splash proof.3. Noise Cancellation is not that good, the music can be heard from outside when at it's high volume.  Though u may not be able to hear the outer noise when u hearing in to the music.4. Quality of material should have been little better. U have to be careful while taking out of your neck. Use both hands to take out and take in. May break if u use one hand to do this task.My overall comment is to go for this Headset if u have less budget and need Thumping sound that too with warranty of 1 year and brand name.\n\n", '\n\n  Build quality - looks decent, though time will tell, but should last atleast a year when handled with some care. Buttons lack operational aesthetics.Music Quality - average "hi-fi"ness or richness of sound. Loudness is good. Bass is ok. Treble is below average. The sound quality feels to be blocked somewhere. Though not a shocker at this price range but still could have been better as it\'s a Harman product.Call quality is decent. Battery life is impressive.Comfort - Ear pads are well cushioned hence shouldn\'t cause much problem even if worn for 2-3 hours straight. Also they fit well and comfortably tight, so could be used with exercises or jogging. No cushion in head band but not a deal breaker on comfort. 2way Folding earpads improve the handling and storing.My verdict:So if you are a music enthusiast who craves and well understands the richness of music quality, look for other options at higher budget.If budget constraints and usage is mostly movies/tv and calls i.e general purpose, then you can consider it.\n\n', '\n\n  First of all this is  a "Good Product" from Infinity. Believe me you won\'t regret purchasing it, surely better than its competitors like Boat, Boult Audio, etc.Few important things to note that its battery is very reliable for heavy usage people like me, have used it for bass boosted music to intense gaming audios, trust me it will fulfill all your needs.I won\'t tell you the specs coz you them already. Between first 10 days, it didn\'t showed any faults or errors, but yeah it has some, they are as follows:1. Audio off problems during zoom meetings, audio is not audible when you connect the headphone to mobile or laptop during the  ongoing meeting. You will have to switch the audio to speakers and then do switch to headphone. But if you have connected to mobile or laptop before joining meeting then no trouble at all.2. When switching on the headphones the power on off button doesn\'t responds, like you keep it holding but headphone won\'t start, although encountered this problem very less.These all problems emerged after the return period, so not able to return it. Though these 2 issues aren\'t a deal-breaker for me.So no complaints regarding this as the bass is too good.People complaining about the fit issue or uncomfortableness for the headphones, if you are purchasing the headphones for very first time you might feel it bit tough on your ears coz the earcups are rigid initially as the are new. You will get comfortable with it within a week, I Guarantee.Music lovers, Gamers no lag in sound compared to the wired headphones), Students, Work from home people...this product will fulfill all of you!!.......IF YOU HAD TIME READING MY REVIEW, PLEASE HIT THE LIKE BUTTON SO THAT I WILL KNOW PEOPLE DO READ IT AND I SHALL REVIEW PRODUCTS FOR OTHERS EVERY TIME I BUY A PRODUCT.THANK YOU.\n\n', '\n\n  Not at all good for calls.

Was promised to pick up and replace it, now no one seems ready for it.__________________________________One can use it for listening music that does not need attention and clarity all the time. Not reliable for calls, meeting and classes. Its less than a month and blue tooth start to disconnect frequently and doesn't connect by itself. The worst part is when it disconnect, the voice switch to phone in loudspeaker mode and create disturbance to other and your conversations will be heard by all except you. I bought it for office meetings but already faced embarrassment few times already. Important to highlight that nothing is changed since I started using it, neither I used different phone nor I used it carelessly. I have 4 Bluetooth headsets from other brands and using since last 4 years. This one bought last month is first bad experience. Now I am going to approach customer care and lets see if anything can be done. Else will be waste of money.\n\n", "\n\n  This is a good headset nothing great to write about... few tweaks on your equalizer and good sub Rs. 1000 headset sounds the same.Battery life is definitely to write about.. its great or lets say amazing and a single recharge can last for advertised 75 hours or more depending how you use it... however, when the lady starts singing 'battery low' every five minutes and you still keep the headset on... the low battery mode can last for more than an 1 1/2 hour!! (still testing with low volume at home mode while writing this review). This is a waste.. come on JBL.. why would you set battery low mode so high.. You could have 76+ hours or more.Fix the low battery mode and increase the speaker size to 40mm, this could be a almost perfect headset. Cheers!\n\n", '\n\n  Although the headphones have medium sound quality, they are not comfortable to wear for long periods. Connecting with other devices is easy and does not take much effort. The range is limited though, and drops within the house (in some corners). Being light weight, it is more focused towards portability. The audio quality is not up to the mark of Sennheiser headphones (HD 202) which I have already - but they are wired, and are showing signs of trouble after 2 years of usage. I wanted a wireless headphone, and hence I bought this. If you really enjoy listening to quality music, this is strictly not for you. These are ideal for watching videos or movies.Coming to the main point, the headphones are not at all comfortable to wear for extended periods and cause pain on the ear lobes when used for an hour or so. The hand-band is also designed in such a way that it touches your scalp and does not have the right curve to go above the head. Any efforts to adjust the headset leaves it lopsided on the ears. Battery life seems to be good though.\n\n', '\n\n  I purchased this headphone to use mainly for office conference call. (Work from Home)When it comes to music or listening to your favorite songs,  the sound quality is not that great as compared to wired head phone. Bluetooth technology comes with some trade off in audio compression and loss of minor details audio quality.If you are looking for just attending conference call (for work) it is best suited. If you are looking for music/listening to your favorite songs with details to full extent, then this is not the best one.Battery backup claimed is 20 hours. I have tested it many times. The actual battery backup is around 7 hrs of listening time which is sufficient for most office work could last for 2 to 3 days in single recharge.\n\n', "\n\n  Not at all worth the price. Waste of moneyPros-Bluetooth works fine upto 6-7 mtrBattery is good, can use for hours without chargingCons-Voice breaks in conference calls/webex call. I thought it is a problem with internet but with othet headphone it works perfectly well whereas this headphone cannot hear the voice properly.It automatically disconnects during call.Cannot use more than 30 min. The coushioning is not at all good, it pains after sometime.Buttons are not very user friendly. Connecting & disconnecting is not smooth.Overall it's not worth the price mainly due to the discomfort on the ear.\n\n", '\n\n  Not great as name (Infinity-JBL), sound is not good , no deep bass, no treble,  sounds just an ordinary head phone. not worth buying even @1499/..look for some other head phone.Company should recall this product, very thigh grip on head, not comfortable, after 10 or 15 minutes paid starts around ear and head..\n\n', '\n\n  If you are getting this product for Rs. 1299 then it is totally worth buying it.Product is sturdy buildwise.Bass is not there - the way we Indians prefer it.Ok for phone calls but most of the time you need to speak on a higher vocal note if you want the receiver to be able to hear you.Prolonged use will cause pain in either of your ears.Somewhat comfortable. Good for rough or daily use.Battery backup is exactly what the brand claims to be.And it has a micro USB 2.0 charging connector.\n\n', '\n\n  Totally all fake reviews on amazon can’t trust This headphones very small and suitable only for kids under 14+  I feel uncomfortable over ear lot of pain with cushions doesn’t look like jbl very poor quality product  definitely not recommended uncomfortable to wear even 4 minutes for extended periods of time.\n\n', '\n\n  I bought this mainly to take calls for the wfh situation. The call quality is amazing. At par with any good wired headphones with mic. The sound quality is great as well, especially the mids and lows. Don’t expect thumping base on this but it’s pretty good for a 36mm driver headphone and the price point.Review after 1 month of usage: Changing it to 1 star from 4 stars:The Bluetooth disconnects very frequently and it’s very frustrating especially if you’re on calls. Some times just the speakers stop working and I can’t hear anything on the call and I have to disconnect and switch to laptop speakers. Don’t buy this if you’re planning to use it for calls.\n\n', '\n\n  This how a big brand try to cater to mass market.Sound Quality: Bang for buck, good output however bass mode is just a gimmick it distorts overall output. Normal mode is good enough, bass heads should look for other options.Build: Cheap plastic and fragile, will not last long. You can literally hear the spring tension while pressing the power button.Bluetooth: Connectivity is a hit or a miss, I have issues while connecting it to my samsung 4K smart TV, it keeps on disconnecting and re-pairing.The biggest issue so far is switching between apps on Android smartphone (checked on motorola and OnePlus 5) If you are listening to music for more than 10 mins and a call comes, you will be able to hear the ringtone but aa soon as pick up the call, caller will not be able to hear you and vice a versa. So a big fail in that department. You can switch between the speaker and bluetooth "sometimes" to fix the issue.Support: Pathetic, sent them an email 5 days ago, no response so far.So, think and decide.\n\n', "\n\n  For the price it's not bad for a starter wireless headset. Calls, Music, Charge, Connectivity - good as expected. This review is to highlight two problems I faced.Comfort: not comfortable...the ears hurt after an hour of use. Also there is a pressure on the ear drums that is relieved within a few secs of moving the headset away.Noise cancellation - non-existent. Also walking around with the headset is the biggest turnoff because you can feel/hear the thud as you walk around - whether it's music or calls it spoils the experience sadly.\n\n", "\n\n  Pro: Superb quality headphones for this price, thought of getting some high end headphones of sony and bose.Now am happy to buy this and its natural noise cancellation doesn't get anything from outside, on suggestion friends also ordered this and they are happy with the quality, Go for it u don't get better product at this price.Cons: Cannot use for longer time ear gets hot, it's same with other high end headphones as well, but it's good to use office purpose,games and some music with quality.\n\n", '\n\n  Purchased after reading many reviews.

You get feeling of listening music on LL or that cheap sound! Please don't buy this product! Not worth at all! Those who haven’t used headphones in their life or first time users may find it ok or awesome but people like me who already came across dolby sound quality will not accept it at-all,ofcourse in this price range you may not get dolby experience but they are having some technical issue using low frequency response generating low cost material used in driver, actually should be using high quality diaphragm to produce freq.response upto 20 khz ideally, but these headphones are only giving BASS no TREBLE at all! Please spend more to get quality headphones ! Else don’t buy!🙏\n\n", '\n\n  Irrespective of all Good quality , major issue with this product is product is tight in fitment. Which makes the user irritating after some time as we need soft touch which is missing here. Curvature is too tight i mean distance between 2 ears is issue here even if I slide the the curve distance is not going to be easy. I thought may be i am hyper sensitive so thought to leave this fact but when my daughter complaint the same then I realised issue is with design. Product is too good bit design is a major flaw here\n\n', '\n\n  Since this was a JBL by Harman product and for the price it was offered it looked like a good deal. Unfortunately apart from the amazing battery that runs almost 20 hours the sound is average. Also, its ear cushions are not really soft and actually causes ears to pain after half hr or 1 hr of use especially if you were spectacles as well. I keep the sound volume at 70 which is quite high but the sound is very low compared to other headsets of the same price. Also i had to untick all sound enhancements in windows 10, with enhancements the sound is even worse.The product would have gone from average to outstanding only if the sound quality was better.\n\n', "\n\n  I am 40 years old male. This product is NOT comfortable to wear. After seeing so many reviews through YouTube only I have opted this wireless headphone. Battery is ultimate. But the main problem is If I use this for continuous 10 minutes that is enough. I will get headache definitely. I DON'T like this product. I don't have any health issues like sinus headache or anything like that. But after using this headphone only I face severe headache. I stopped using this headphone after 2 months. Writing this review after 4 months. Probably if you are a teenager I think it will be alright. But for me I DON'T SUGGEST. Only a single star. That rating is also too much for this worthless product.\n\n", '\n\n  Sturdy headphones with bad frequency response.- The build seems sturdy- The the ear pieces are very tight over the head, it will start paining after a couple of minutes of usage.- The frequency of the speakers are not as per specifications. It is only from 20hz to 15khz. Where as what is advertised in the box is 20hz to 20khz. This itself is a big blunder from Harman Infinity.- Call quality, the response of microphone is very bad. The voice gets muffled.This will be a good headphone for kids as their head will be small and the earpieces will cause pain for them because of the tightness.If you are a person who likes bass and not sound quality, and if your head size is very small(tiny), then this headphone will be a good option.I would not recommend this headphones for anyone, better to go for a higher quality with a little higher price.\n\n', '\n\n  Everything is far more perfect except one thing it can not support well on voice call. Voice output is good, clear and pure; but Bluetooth connectivity is not good for calling. While you are on the call, Bluetooth connectivity get disconnected automatically.

I compared it with a few in this price range, this one is outstanding.•Battery backup offer by the company is 20hrs, and it meets the mark. And in comparison with other products in this range, most offer 5 to 10hr backup.•Bluetooth 5.0 got its own advantagesCons•On the ear desing is not my favourite. Few hours of usage, it starts to sweat on the earpads. And otherwise a few more hours your ear starts to hurt.•Noise cancelation is not electronic, it's because of the tight earpads. So you can't turn is off. That's expected of this price.•The buttons feel cheap and so does the whole plastic body of the product.•Voice calling is not its strong hold. You can do calling, mic qulity is not good so voice is not very crisp on the other end. Sometimes you hear some ringing sound from inside the headphones.\n\n", "\n\n  In one word they are- ‘Awesome’. Been using them for more than a month now. I was using Boat Rockerz 400 (BR400) earlier. They were good enough too, but headband broke after 2 years. But Infinity Glide 500 (IG500)  are at another level at this price.Build Quality- Compared to BR400, IG500 look and feel super premium. Those looked and felt so damn cheap. It’s like comparing cheap Chinese phones to Apple. IG500 are light weight too. Fit perfectly onto the ear, and never caused any discomfort. I’ve used them straight for more than 2 hours and never experienced any discomfort. I love them. Never thought they’d be this good.Sound Quality- Starting with two modes: Normal and Deep Bass, they don’t differ that much but there’s a slight more bass in Deep Bass mode. The difference is so less that a person wouldn’t even notice which mode the headphones are in. Bass is great and sound is clear.Bass: 9/10Treble: 8/10Battery: It never dies. Lol. I mean BR400 had 7hrs of battery life and need to be charged every 2-3 days but these go on for a week. I’m extremely satisfied.Noise Cancellation: BR400 didn’t have this feature. They just blocked some amount of noise but IG500 has something for sure. These block a significant amount of noise.Calling: Mic is great. Sound is clear to the other person. No distortion experienced.Gaming: There’s a minor lag while gaming for sure. BR400 performed better while gaming when compared to these.Connectivity: Superb when compared to BR400. Connect within half a second every time. Range is great. No issues at all.Moreover, BR400 has an irritating voice notifying when it’s switched On or Off or when connected or disconnected on full volume , but these IG500 have a calm-sweet voice for that which doesn't irritate. Micro USB for charging, no USB-C. And no headphone jack if battery dies. And no cushion on the headband, but it’s not bad at all.Final Verdict- I have no words how awesome they are. They feel great, sound awesome, look superb, everything works great, more than expected at this price. I recommend them.\n\n", '\n\n  I am given this 5 star because I have to give it. Here is the reason:Before this I have been purchased 7-8 wireless headphones but none of them could satisfied me just because of one reason i.e. all of them were capturing outside voices during talks..that was really frustrating for me ...Them I just purchased this one without much interest just wanna give try to INFINITY one....But woow , woow means wow....what a headphone is this.....some of features are1. Outside voices capturing—NONE2. Ear 👂 pain event after 4-5 hours — NONE3. Battery 🔋 backup...2 days minimum4. Sounds quality....no need to tell if it’s about JBL\n\n', "\n\n  This is my first BlueTooth (BT) Headphone and I bought it after reading the reviews as well as after viewing reviews on YouTube. To be very honest, this is a very nice headphone (I can't compare it with others since this is my first BT headphone). The below review is based on 2 days of use.Pro:- Sound Quality is good and clear- Bass is just right as per me even in Normal Mode. EQ mode doesn't make much difference.- Foldable and light weight (as advertised)- Good Battery Life (as advertised)- Comfort is also OK but there is always room for improvement.- I wear spects but using the headphone for longer duration doesn't give much of pain.- Receiving and making phone calls using some calling application like WhatsApp is also clear and other party can hear you very nicely so the MIC is also good.Now you would wonder, why have I mentioned taking calls using some calling application in the Pro above? The answer to that is mentioned in the Con section.Cons (Issues):- When receiving a normal phone call, neither me nor the calling party can hear each other. I have to switch to phone mode and then back to BT mode to start the conversation with the caller. This is a major problem for someone using this for phone calls.- While taking call, my headphone got disconnected and reconnected automatically thrice during a single call at an interval of approximately 10 mins each. After re connection, neither of us can hear each other. I have to switch off and switch on the BT headphone to start the conversation by keeping the caller on hold.Due to above 2 Cons, I replaced my headphone once but still the same problem. Hence raised a return for the same finally. Due to above 2 issues, I have rated this headphone a 2 star because, according to me, these 2 issues are a DEAL BREAKER.Request to Team Infinity - Kindly look into the above 2 issues mentioned and provide some suggestion.\n\n", "\n\n  Im writing this review after using one month. I'm very satisfied with the product and quality. Only negative thing is we can't wear it for long time. It hurts the ears.Sound quality is very good.Noise cancellation is also good.I attend office meetings (skype or Teams) with this headphones.Hope my review will help to choose the right headphones.ThanksHidayath\n\n", '\n\n  After using Sony, Bose and similar bands, wanted to get something light and have used JBL speakers in past, which had good sound.This headset wins in the sound department, but has very plasticky build and slides are very bad. The plastic make it feel very cheap. No pouch provided so you have to be very careful if you plan to carry it durin travel.There is no separate button for the dual equalizer, you have to press vol+, vol- simultaneously.Overall could have had better build, sound wise is good, however cannot be worn for long hours.\n\n', '\n\n  First of all I am not a professional reviewer of any products but I dare to write this review after using it for 2 days. This is an excellent headphone at this price tag. Dual equalizer are very effective. Sound quality may not be compared with very high end headphones but still it has clear sound with good bass. I like the lightness of the headphone. Bluetooth is capable to connect  it with other device seamlessly 25 to 30 feet away. Built quality is comparable to mid range headphones of other reputed brands available in the market but its Infinity logo gives it a premium looks. Battery backup is also impressive. I am sure noboby would lament if he/she buy this one.\n\n', '\n\n  When I was placing order then only thing I consider it\'s coming from Harman Kardon. Before I purchased boat products. They are decent but not excellent. But when I saw Harman Kardon Product at affordable price I made no wait. Delivery was decent. In rural areas of Purulia they sent me within 3 days without prime. When I\'m writing this review it\'s only a few hours spent after they delivered the product. It\'ll be too early to say that it\'s a amazing product. But unbiasedly to say I\'m writing this review while listening "Believer" is a true immersive experience. Okay, now I want to say some points in Pros & Cons as you can decide it\'s made for you or a deal breaker.Pros:1.Truely Crystal Clear Sound. I\'ve used so many headphones in this price range. But really it\'s a game changer.2.Battery life is not being tested. But consider as  the Harman Kardon is saying 20 hours. If it give minimum 12 hours it also will be a master blaster.3.Really Lightweight. No problem to listen songs for long time.4.Design is very elegant as I bought the black one.5.Noise Cancellation is decent. When you\'ll listen songs then you\'ll totally forget about surroundings.Cons:1.No 3.5 mm jack is really disappointing. It may be deal breaker for some people. Harman Kardon should have provided it.2.No proper cushioning on the head. Though Ear cushioning is decent enough.3.Dual EQ mode is nothing but a gimmick. It just emphasizes bass. Not so effective. But you can\'t make any complain against their sound quality. It\'s really good. Believe Me!4.Totally plastic built though it has decent built quality. It may be for reducing weight.5.It is a bit tight to wear. But I think it might be fixed as I\'ll regularly use it.Overall:Sound Clarity Quality: 8/10Bass Quality : 7/10Treble Quality: 8/10High & Low notes: 8/10Convenient to Wear for long time: 7/10Built Quality: 7/10Battery Life: 8/10Total: 8/10Must go with this if you want to buy headphones under 2k. This has now no competitor under 2k except Mivi Saxo. But this is better than Saxo. Go with this considering above points. Music is Life :)\n\n', '\n\n  Pros:1. Battery ( Really last more than 60 hours)2. Build quality (More than average)3. Sound quality (Better than any other under 2.5K)4. Cushion is softCons:1. Bad ergonomics2. You will feel ear pain after 4-5 hour of continuous usage3. Bluetooth is worst, keep disconnecting and connecting while on call. Do not support two simultaneous connection. To connect another device you have to repair it with previous one afterwards.\n\n', "\n\n  There is many things other than bass which requires in headphone ..boat mivi or many Chinese crap who tagged all products by naming extra bass but no detail in of other than bass..such beats trable drum.and equally synchronise.. which no one hadThis is sub brand of jbl.It has everythingBattery 20+hrsBass -good (not extreme)Build quality is excellentMany of other might believe I'm writing paid review but when you buy almost every product to find one good  .so its important to put review to save others time my profile how many headphone I have brought from Amazon and thanks to Amazon which provided me all returns and refunds which was unsatisfactory .. at least I have been brought three models of mivi two models of tagg inferno boat rockerz 255 and other two bot models and many other brands still I didn't find any think goodYou can check..But now journey has ended I have found one good 20 which has excellent battery backup and good quality of sound\n\n", "\n\n  I have been waiting to buy JBL 450BT Headset when an offer is being applied on it. My budget was  around 1500 rupees only.  I have checked the sound quality of Boat rockers 400, 440,. JBL400bt 450bt. And also  leaf headsets. When i saw the infinity glide  500 by Harman(the same comp which makes JBL) and as a part of launch in India. They had an offer price 1400 rupees. With no reviews.  I decided to buy  the product anyway.  Let me tell you one thing. The headset is far better than all the headsets  mentioned above.  The bass is just ultimate.. even the smallest of the sound is being  played with perfection.  They don't have an aux port.  Consider the quality it can be ignored. 2 hrs charging gives you 20 hrs playback. Strongly recommend  it to everyone. You will  love it.\n\n", "\n\n  I needed a pair of headphones for my morning run, I used my partners infinity glide 500 and I really liked it and I decided to purchase the 510 on a daily deal for 1499.I still have yet to charge the damn thing! I've been using it straight from the box. I use it on an average an hour a day. its been 15 days and its still on 50%(indicative on the phone). Thats amazing.BUT,The sound is very average, almost muffled through some tracks. IF thats on the headphones or the hardware of the phone/software of the streaming service I don't know. I didn't purchase it for calls, but during calls I have to be in a quiet environment because this thing will pick up a fart from a dog two blocks down.It meets my purpose and I intend to review this deeper in the future.\n\n", '\n\n\n\n\n                    The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0Sound quality is good balanced no problem at high volume the bass can be tweaked with bass booster aap soo no problem it is some what less comfortable but still better tham in ear earphone 1star because my own STOPED WORKING 3 days after purchase the power button not working so i replaced thanks for amazon.

It gives me 2 days. 24hrs connected each day. With playing time around 14-16 hours. Thats roughly 6-8 hrs a day which in my opinion is great.Sound quality is as expected from a sub- brand of jbl is adequate but excellent with price point.Noise cancellation is good, better than the in ear ones by the same brand.Bass quality is good, not great not that you feel extraordinary but yeah works.It do have HD sound option when connected with my Oneplus 7 pro.I also own sony wch500 on the ear bluetooth wireless headset and on comparing there was just a little diff between the two. I am no expert but for me watching videos and playing games were good on both these products.My overall experience is great with one month of usage.Definitely go for this if you're hoping to buy it someday.Try to order in sale, 1600 is bit too priced, sales can get you this aorund 1300-1400.Hope you liked the review.\n\n", "\n\n  What is the point of 72 hours when you can't wear it for a couple of hours without getting ear pain.!!! Not comfortable enough to wear it for long periods. Sound quality is great, noise cancellation is good. Bass quality is good too. But can't wear it for more than a couple of hours. Build quality is Okay. Everything is plastic. There is no Wired option, guess it is not needed when battery this long. Never got to find the actual battery life as it is painful to wear longer periods.\n\n", "\n\n  The Package was damaged though the Headphone was not damaged. My guess, someone put some heavy things on this which led to damage of packet.Now let's talk about headphone itself. It was not damaged at all by the damaged packing. But it's not as good as everyone is saying here.It says it's by HARMAN the same company which makes JBL but it's no where close to JBL. I already own a JBL headphone and it is super 🤗. This Infinity tried to be a good one but didn't qualify much.The audio is clear but isn't as clear as in JBL. The bass is deep which can be changed to normal bass. In normal bass, there is absolutely No Bass at all. The bass also feels unnatural sometimes.It fits very tightly on ears so it cancels outside noise. But this will lead to sweaty ears soon enough.Headphone is very light, feels cheap plastic.If crystal clear audio is your priority, buy JBL or Sony for that matter. This is just ok ok type. Atleast it is better than the Boat headphone at same price.\n\n", '\n\n  There’s some sort of noise from the right side speakers only. It seems like a hollow space in there when I hit it with a finger and it makes a different type of noise everytime I use it to hear someone whole on call. I haven’t felt this problem while listening to music. It’s not all bad. It could be the problem with just this piece.Update 04/08/20 : that noise is very irritating to work for 8 hours.\n\n', '\n\n  Sounds quality is good but there sometimes there is disturbance/noise in the sound.Pros:- good battery lifeCons- ear pain if used for too long (3-4 hours continuously)- sometimes there is noise/interference in the sound. (Edit: most of the times).- can not connect to two devices at a time- despite being connected sometimes i can not hear the audio. i have to disconnect and reconnect. (It is annoying when you are in a meeting and audio stops abruptly).EDIT: Changing the four start rating to three. Used this product for over a week and it is uncomfortable if you used continuously for a long duration.EDIT 2: The disturbance is too annoying. There is no option of a refund. I feel like I wasted money on this product. Changing the rating from 3 to 1 start. If I am paying 1600-1800 rupees on a product I expect to have a decent sound quality. Totally worthless product. Better to chose other products.\n\n', "\n\n  I was very much disappointed by the performance of this instrument. Yes the battery was good and even after 3 days' use it was remaining about 45-50%.But it seriously lacks in the basic work of souñd. I am user of apple earphones which I had received with the phone so I will compare with it.1.....510 was giving about half of the volume of my wired handsfree on max volume.2......The sound was nice with Apple handset but it deminished drastically with other phones. It was worst with MI phones.3......normal and power modes of sound are useless. The sound was distorted and broken in high bass.4...... Headset was tight initially but relaxed a bit later but still it was causing sweat on ears and was hurting ears.5......built quality was ok but frame looked too big and the sticker mentioned that it was made in china.6...... You will buy it for sound but I will not recommend it for this and there is no other purpose.7....... If you hear low sound and you have iPhone then it can be used otherwise don't buy.It will hurt your ears if you aren't accoustomed.It may look good if it is your first headset but of you are a sound lover then it is not for you.\n\n", "\n\n  The earpiece isn't as big as many headphones out there, and it doesn't cover the entire ear. It  simply sits on the outer periphery of your ear. For ones who sweat a lot, you will need to constantly clean it off the earpad and maybe disinfect it periodically. The sound isn't completely isolated from the external environment, so you won't get that immersive experience like on premium products. In addition to this, the first time you use this product, it could cause pain in your ear, only externally that is, if used constantly. So you need to take breaks constantly. But it will loosen over a month's time. For those who wear specs, just slightly lift the handles of your specs and then place these headphones first, and then place your specs back. It seems easier than explained here. This way u can avoid you bears getting squished between the earpiece and your specs handle.The max volume of the device is on the lower side as well. The bass function on this device is quite over done! I wasn't personally satisfied with it since it was too heavy on bass. Some people might like it. But luckily, you can switch to the normal mode as well.Apart from the above, the battery life is absolutely incredible, so this becomes handy especially if your keep travelling or go on long trips with limited power bank support. After charging of approximately less than 2 hours for a full charge, it will last for a week or more, if you use it for 6 hours daily maybe. Now this depends on the volume u use as well, and it could vary.Overall a great product, after all it is a subsidiary of Samsung, and do not miss the opportunity if you're looking a decent headphone and you wish to avoid the other cheaper ones in the market. This product may not feel premium, but it looks fine overall and does a good job.\n\n", "\n\n  This is an honest reviewInfinity glide 510 is a perfect headphones under 2k price with bass.Pros-Good bass-Good battery life - more than 50hours- No lag in playing pubg-Aweosme connectivity and shows battery-Did I tell you it has a good bassCons-It's really tight around the ears-You can't have this on for more than 30minIf you really want a good battery life then this is it. Every other headphones in the market does not have battery life and you'l be charging again and again.\n\n", '\n\n  Not comfortable to wear for more than hour! Earlobes start to pain and soon the pain becomes unbearable! Cant return the product. The cushion for ears is too small to fit comfortably on ears. Go for a headphone with oval shaped earpiece / cushion.Works okay with laptop for office calls. For a normal call / whatsapp call, the person at the other end complains that the voice is too weak and seems to be coming from far away.Not much noise cancellation. Bluetooth works for about 10-15 feet. After that its useless. Sometimes it becomes better when you go closer to source and sometimes the audio goes blank even if you then go and stand close to the bluetooth source.With so many problems, i dont think these headphones are worth the money spent.\n\n', "\n\n  After using this product for a month I am writing this review.Very disppointed with this headsetFirst major turnoff is frequent and abrupt disconnection while talking on phone observed that it gets disconnected automatically.Not recommended for outdoor calls..  can't handle slight disturbanceAlso you sound feeble when u are in conversationAlso this is on ear headphone so ur ear starts paining after couple of hours of usage.Battery life is goodNot recommended at all\n\n", "\n\n  My review is based on personal usage of normal music listening and not for Studio work. I was looking for a pair of headphones that were cheap, with bluetooth, easy to carry and gave good sound. Believe me, these headphones have all that and more for a great price.- easily foldable- great bluetooth connection that does not crack even if you walk further away from your device- very clear inbuilt mic- you can pick up and cut calls from the Power button on the headphones- sound wise, the top end can be clearer and after reading other people's reviews about the bass being too loud, I disagree. I think it's perfect. If you do find it heavy, you can reduce it as well.- I also read people found the volume to be a bit low, but personally it works. You can make it louder from the headphones itself or your device. Volume was fine for me- The cans are a bit tight around the head,but I've been told they will become more comfy with time so I'm willing to ride it out!- The colour looks great. I bought a Red one, so it looks pretty cool. It's a Dark Maroon ish colour.- over all - a beautiful pair of headphones at a very comfortable and affordable price.Just buy them!\n\n", "\n\n  There is lots of mixing in sound. No clarity in sound. But sound is appropriate to price.Main problem is with cushions, reality is you can't use infinity 510 more than half an hour , although it has 72 hour battery backup , Total waste of money. Cushions are not soft as per standards.Bluetooth connectivity is fast. Although It always get connected to last device connected, when you have 2 or more devices inclusive of last device it rapidly finds the last device used and connects to it immediately.Buttons works well.Calling feature is good.Works fine with Google assistant.I will not recommend Infinity 510 for use.\n\n", '\n\n  I love this headphone.The product quality is really good. I can go on and on about the ease of use, the LONG BATTERY, the sound quality, etc.I have used it with my mobile phone and also with my laptop. In both cases, I loved the performance.The only CON that I noticed may be largely personal. My head is big. My ears are also big. I wear spectacles too. When I use this headphone for a long duration, I find that my ears start to hurt. The main area is where the ear gets squeezed between the headphone and the spectacle arms.Note for self: next time take bigger diameter headphones!Recommendation to others: worth the price and more!\n\n', "\n\n  I am more or less satisfied with the sound quality but I can't give this product more than 2/5 in terms of satisfaction due to following twi issues which are important for me.1. If the headphone is connected to a device, and you want to connect to another device than you have to manually disconnect the headphone from the device before connecting to some other device. This is important for me because I use 3-4 devices - Laptop, Desktop, Tablet, phone. But for this headphone to connect to other device you have to manually disconnect from one before connecting with one.For eg if you are connected to a device which is in another room thane you have to go to that room and manually disconnect it . Ideally there should be a button to disconnect or if you arr switching off the headphone than it should get disconnect.n2 There is a light on right that keeps on blinking every 5 seconds. and that is very annoying. That means if I am listening in the night than my roommate will keep on complaining about the blinking light . Thay blinking light doesn't stop and it keeps on blinking every 5 seconds forever and which is too irritating . I don't understand what in the Earth is the purpose of that annoying blinking light.\n\n", "\n\n  The infinity glide 500 is really a good headphones to own. It is of good quality even though it is made of plastic. The earcups rest on your ear which can cause slight discomfort if used for prolonged hours, but is nothing serious. Considering it is a budget wireless headphone don't expect the best noise cancellation feature from the device. For your every day events and music this will be a great choice with good sound quality, bass, and volume levels. The double eq mode makes it bit better for music. I love the battery life I'm currently getting on this one(been using it for just over a week now). Overall it's a great one to consider. Also it can be easily folded in a couple of ways to carry easily.\n\n", '\n\n  If you Are bass lover , go for it blindly you won’t regret on this. Though it’s not studio sound ( at this price this is anyway not possible) you will like punchy bass effect. Normal bass mode is perfect you won’t need to switch to deep bass mode. If you are iPhone user then you can get best sound output in late night and bass booster mode. At this price point , this is the best you can get in market till date. Bass is as good as Sony xb headphone which starts with price range of 7000. Ear cushion is little harder , it will take time to get used to with that. Bluetooth range is much better than other Bluetooth devices. This comes with 36mm drivers (previous models 501and 500 were with 32mm driver) which provides very good bass than it’s preceder. I read some negative reviews also here but I didn’t find any cons / limitation in this headphone in this price range. Overall Sound quality awesome. Battery back up is also fantastic in single charge. Value for money this is the best in market you can get at this price range.\n\n', '\n\n  honestly, if you are buying it for the tagline "deep bass" then actually you are wasting your money. Rather you should go for wired ones in this price segment, they will be much better. yeah, the bass is bit too much muffled, but i\'m sure ur expectations after watching video reviews wont match with the original product.NOW COMING TO THE SOUND QUALITY:1)these have a pretty descent sound quality if you listen to vocals and all a lot.2)the mids are okay, lows are bit too much muffled, highs are again average.3)if you turn on the deep bass mode, then it will mix up all the notes in a minimum scale which will cause deduction in details.BUT STILL IT SOMEHOW MANAGES TO SOUND GOOD THAN OTHER HEADPHONES IN THIS RANGEDURABILITY:its okay if you use it at home, and obviously not okay if outside.COMFORT:the worst in this segment.biggest con: NO AUX CABLE OPTIONconclusion: if u really do wanna buy a wireless headphone below 2000, then go for it...direct no to mi superbass and the boat ones.\\\\\\ rather go for wired solutions cause they sound much better in this same range.\n\n', '\n\n  I write this review after using 1 year.bass is goodThe battery backup is good.1. Come to connectivity: which is very bad, while you are on Call, and if it is disconnected then it is reconnected as Bluetooth but the call is not connected on Bluetooth.2. When you are on call and in between calls you connect this Bluetooth your call is not to switch on Bluetooth.3. If you are on call and sometimes if you cross-range and come again in range then from another side of call voice is not coming, now you have to switch speaker mode and again select Bluetooth mode then the voice is coming correct.\n\n', '\n\n  1. Awesome Bluetooth pairing. Connects flawlessly every time.2. Sound quality is normal. Did not find noticeable difference between normal and deep base mode.3. This is the best feature. Call quality is really good for a Bluetooth headset. People do not even know that you might be talking through a Bluetooth headset. Just feels very normal as if you are speaking directly through mobile phone mic.4. Battery backup is really good for such light weight and sleek looking headset.Overall, a great buy in under 1500/-. I got it for 1519/-.\n\n', '\n\n\n\n\n                    The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0Damn! Does this get charged on its own?Pros:Impressive battery life.

Enjoy 8D audiosNoise cancellaion: Just enough to cut nuisance from aroundSoft earpads. You can see that in the video with this reviewCons:Tight: I have a medium size head for most adults and its too tight. It does not get loose with time. I would not rate it high on comfort.Intrusive LED: the blue blink you see in the video-  there is no way to turn it off/ dim it. Its very disturbing when lights are off and you wear them.Its the best headphone you get for this price bracket in 2021. The 72 hours battery life is not an unwarranted claim by JBL. It actually lasts this much or more\n\n', "\n\n  Well, after reading reviews I thought I had made a mistake but after two days of use I can say that you can go for it.Neither I had ear pain after a 3 hour online class, nor it is a discomfort wearing on your ears. There is no active noise cancellation but it reduces noise by a huge extent.If you are planning to take a cheap headphone under 1500, this could be the best choice.It is so lightweight and small that you can say it's a toy. Sound quality is also good. My overall experience was very good. Also it's a subsidiary of Harman which itself is a subsidiary of Samsung so you can definitely count on it.\n\n", '\n\n  Guy’s don’t even think of buying saying ad of HARMAN , JBL or anything like that because it has only battery backup not to listen music everyone who listened music through this headphone got headache ear problems due to it’s sound..I packed it back the way it came now I am stuck sience it’s non-refundable..Beleive me may be buy a 100rs product in the footpath will give you better sound and more importantly no headache.\n\n', '\n\n  I came from Senheisser and AudioTechnica spending most of my time wearing sophisticated phones. But i have to say this small headphone impress me. Bass is better than some 10k phones like the M50x. Its light and you move freely without wire. The best thing it did is the sound quality and its portability.  The sound is very clear doesnt make any static noises. It pitch better than some studio toys. Its nothing but very much for the price raange. Battery seems nice 7hrs easily. I bought it for testing with my laptop and will keep it with me. Lastly i have to say the ear cup is a little small but surprisingly comfort to wear it. There is no soft sponge in the head rest but it is alright as it is very light. At night its actually better.\n\n', "\n\n  For the cost it is really great. The earpiece could have been bigger, and it doesn't have active noise cancellation, but that you wont get for this price.The volume was acceptable and the bass for this size was good enough.My ears hurt after wearing it for some time, that was becausea) I wear glasses and this pushes the ear against the ear against that frameb) smaller cupsI bought two separately. I would buy this again, if I lost mine, because it seems sturdy. All the non JBL headsets that I bought including cowin and other brands break at the cup-joint.\n\n", "\n\n  Pro :1. Fast Bluetooth connectivity2. Long battery life3. Light weight4. Cheap5. Microphone works wellCon :1. A bit tight on ears2. Build feels below standard, buttons not good.3. Sound is loud but not that clearFinal verdict : Value for money if you are planning to use it for 2-3 hrs in a strech. Won't recommend for people who need to put on headphone for long period of time.\n\n", "\n\n  Let me start by saying that I was initially a bit sceptical about ordering this, however I was on the lookout for a Bluetooth headphone with good battery life to use while working, where my work hours range from anything between 10-15 hours. This one seemed to fit the bill and was rather affordable. So let me breakdown my experience after using this for almost a month.Battery life - Brilliant battery life.. I charge this at night, start using it in the morning and one day used it all day for about 21 hours on and off.. Listening to music, attending calls from my laptop and phone. Even after 21 hours of use, the battery was still 40%!Sound quality - sound-wise the headphones are not exactly the best, however they are not bad either considering the price point. If you are a heavy bass lover, this might not fit your bill, however being a musician and audio freak myself, I would say the sound was pretty balanced.Material - coming to the material, the body is made of plastic, which I'll say does seem a little flimsy, however I've rough handled this thing and this baby broken yet. So I'll say with a little care this is pretty darn good. Again, for there price you pay is hard to expect too much more.Noise cancellation - again, for the price you pay, those is pretty decent. While it doesn't cancel out all the sound, it does cancel out a fair amount of noise while using.Final Verdict - for the price of this product, I'd say it's really good! Amazing battery life and pretty decent audio quality! If you are expecting good and decent audio quality from a headphone, that too a Bluetooth headphone, at this price range, this one fits right into your bill.Would I buy this again if this breaks? Probably yes!\n\n", "\n\n  Music in the deep bass mode sounds great. Normal mode just like other headphones in this price range. What we get here is the brand known for great audio devices.Built quality could have improved, but it's better than most of them in this budget.You get assist when the device is tuned on or is ready for pairing. So overall user experience is worth the money.BOAT have better value for money options, but this brand justifies the pricing. Thank you Harman for this headphones.\n\n", "\n\n  Received 1 hour back. Sound is so average that I can't enjoy as an audiophile. The headphones claim of frequency reproduction from 20Hz to 20 kHz is totally bogus. Lows I can believe but highs not even remotely. People who don't pay attention to details may still like it.Extra base feature is a mindlessly high unbalanced bass that eats out mids and highs with no clarity. Even people who love bass and have no taste for mids or highs will hate this Deep Bass option.Having said that, the normal bass is good enough. Buttons are very cheap and make crackling sound when you press them.Summary: Audiophiles please keep away from this as this is no treat to ears. Sony headphones are miles ahead of this one.What a shame to see such product coming from my favourite sound masters Harman Kardon.\n\n", "\n\n  Loved these Bluetooth headphones. Clear voice, nice range for music and effortless connectivity.Brought 2 pairs and now the house is completely quiet. No TV or phone noise to disturb me anymore. Connecting is super simple. Battery is amazing. Easily gives 10+ hours in a full charge. Charging is through usb b though.Headphone folds for easy storage. Only problem is the ear cups are a bit small and rest on the ear, don't cover it completely. It's painful after a couple of hours of constant use, though that reminds me to take a break.. so maybe a feature, not a bug ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\n", "\n\n  Using for last 3 days. I can comment few things for now. I bought this for WFH, so I can move around freely during long calls. Beware, Sitting is the new cancer!1. Call quality is good, no issues reported in conference calls. Use indoor and definitely not outdoor friendly2. Bass is high but not loud, so you can enjoy it pleasantly.3. Bluetooth connection is stable on both Windows (21H1) and Android 11.  Any issues with Bluetooth might be software based issue.4. Battery is excellent. Used more than 12 hours with movies and calls at 50% volume. It took around 20% of battery only.5. Headphone is tight and brings pain if we wear incorrectly. Need to adjust the right spot or height to keep it for long time.6.  Charging seems to be good (don't use fast charger), covered 20% in around 20 minutes. 8-10 hours usage in 20 minutes! So, I guess it will be 100% from 0% in around 2 hours.\n\n", "\n\n  Best on price range, those who say it's sound quality is not good please adjust eq and let it burn in. Yes its light weight and battery life is awesome.Headphones littrely vibrate on my ears in deep bass mode keeping vocals and treble on balanced side.Those who don't like bass, remove deep bass and it will be completely balanced.\n\n", "\n\n  The product has decent sound quality. It produces decent punchy bass in normal mode. It has a bass boosted mode. But the bass it produces in that boosted mode is annoying and not harmonious to our ears. Vocals are clear and instrument separation is average. Doesn't really produce much of the higher frequency components effectively though. I have used better ones.It has amazing battery backup . I use it 5 to 6 hours average every day and still it gives me 9 to 10 days battery backup. I have been vigorously mapping it's battery backup for the past one month and I'm amazed by its backup. It's battery is actually 610 mAh according to the specs sheet.It's clamping force is a bit on the higher side. So you really wanna take it off after continuously using it for some 30 to 40 minutes. But I have found a work around to solve this problem. Just stick a long pole or something like that in between the stems of two speakers by elongating the headset without breaking it as far as possible and leave it like that the whole night for every night atleast a week (please check the attached image) . By doing this every day you can reduce the tensile strength of the plastic of the headphone and there by reducing it's clamping force within a short period of time.The headset is really light weight and has fast connectivity but can only be paired with one device at a time\n\n", "\n\n  Excellent product for the price. I am just covering the basics in this review:Battery Life: It is over a month since we bought it, and after regular use, still has over 30% juice left - with the original charge it came with. Hasn't been charged even once yet!Sound quality: depending on the songs you play, the double bass can be jarring (or not). For most purposes, it works well, and at times its more pleasant on normal bass - even then, quality is very good.Connectivity: decent. It can cover a good radius, even through walls (really, one cannot avoid walls when indoors) when you are walking about and your phone is static.Call quality: good. Here, you do not get the expected results. While you can hear the caller well, for the caller, your voice appears a little distant. Can he hear you? Sure. Is it like holding your phone to your ear? Not really - its like you are a bit farther away from the mic.Noise canc: quite good. Careful though: sometimes it can get hot in there after prolonged use!Overall, for the price, this is an excellent headset.\n\n", "\n\n  Hey guys those who wanna buy a new headphones and who are in a dilemma let me clarify a few points for you folks. I got my hands on it today my experience within it is terrific..😍😍😍 Can't experess how happy I am to have them. Earlier I used to have wired headphones from  Philips but they used get into a trouble atleast once in 7 months either connector issue or driver issue so I changed my mind to go for a wireless one.  most of my frnds bought some wireless headphones (not that reputed brand) for nominal price the problem with them was their connectivity. They stopped after a month or two,  then I decided only to go with a reputed brand then I checked boat 450 many customers were unsatisfied with it due to its build quality most them were broken within 6 months then I looked for MI Bass headphones personally they are not that good looking so I came to Infinity it's battery is simply awesome and I have seen its reviews many are complaining about low sound I want to ask them are they Changing sound only on mobile? If yes try changing sound on headphones too at first I too thought that they have a very low volume I was disappointed after increaing on headphones you will feel the true magic.❣️Pros:-Excellent batteryAwesome soundEasy to carryHigh tensile material which won't break so easily(Though it might look a bit normal.)Cons worth mentioning:-No aux port (who needs that when you have insane amount of battery , it's a different case for those who want to experience Dolby Atmos 🤷🤷)Noise cancellation is not that good you can hear surrounding sounds when listening at low volume of you increase the volume then then boom you hear nothing.Size is a bit small but fits exactly on your ears .Bluetooth connectivity takes 3 seconds\n\n", '\n\n  👉👉I purchased this product in September 2019 and it was working very nicely until last month. Its  left side stopped working. I claimed warranty and they just replaced it. I received new headphones today (took 4-5 days).🔥🔥Good Job Infinity!!\n\n', '\n\n  I have used  3 headset with 3 different company models. I was not satisfied with them.  Finally I came to know about  this brand and thought to buy,  I was not happy initially.  After using this headphones I feel more comfortable and voice clarity is good and the person who listens in other side says voice was clear in noisy environment also.  Happy for me  , also I will suggest to those who looks in this price range (voice  clarity,  noise cancellation,  listening to songs, etc..  ) with good battery backup  .Thank you Amazon,  Thank you seller\n\n', "\n\n  I like this headset. The connectivity is excellent. I can listen across 2 fairly sized rooms without any issues. It works perfectly with MS Teams. I haven't had any complaints from the other side during calls. Cushioning is fair, you will get used to it very quickly. Battery is excellent. I don't have to bother about charging it at all. In the last 3 weeks of usage I may have charged it twice or thrice while using it for a min of 5 hours a day.The only problem I have is that, if you tap the right head cup, you feel like you struck a tuning fork. It's also triggered sometimes during calls, probably at some frequencies/pitch. But over time now, its not apparent during calls. I could have expected mutiple connections feature so that switching is easy. But I use it primarily from Laptop. So it does not bother me much.I quite like it.\n\n", '\n\n  Value for money headphones. These are on ear phones. I got these as a cheap pair to use at the gym. I have a higher end 1000XM3 for home use.Pros:1. Decent sound quality for the price. The average joe would be more than happy. I’m personally very happy with the sound quality2. Durable simple light weight plastic build that’s excellent for rough use in the gym3. Firm headband that stays in place during workouts4. Decent noise isolation5. 6 hours of playback so far and still has 50% battery leftCons:1. Cheap build so not sure how long these are going to last2. The infinity label is in bold gold/chrome. A little too much of bling and makes it look a little cheap\n\n', '\n\n  Good parts:Build quality, bass, run time on one charge.Not so good:The right side has a self resonance around 1 kHz. So, if you tap it gently, you can hear a faint ringing at 1 kHz. When using the headphones, therefore, when there are sounds around that frequency (which is quite common), you can make out that a sharper rise in those sounds.When listing to rich music, it may not matter, but it bothers when using it for tele-conference or listening to sift music like Flute.Overall, quite good value for money.\n\n', "\n\n  After listening for ~20 min, decided to return it.Cons:1. No wired option. So once the battery dies, so does your headphone.2. There is a Bass mode and a normal mode, but the resultant audio output can not be compared with E25/E35 etc. This sounds like a hobbyists' work..3. The only type of audio which sounded true to its mark is 60s and 70s bollywood songs. Even Beatles/RocknRoll was not upto the usual 'JBL' audio standard.4. Built of cheap plastic. ( Inferior than JBL's E series )Pro :Its wireless and there's a discount going on at the time of writing this. 😂For those online audiophiles who would advise me to 'burn ur can for 48 hours', please save your breath, coz the sound output would never improve much unless its wired. If you are looking at this review, or considering this pathetic excuse of headphones to buy, remember, you have been warned !!\n\n", '\n\n  Review after over three months of regular use:Pros, cons, comfort, build quality, battery life:Pros: However these budget headphones score good at sound quality, noice cancellation and bass quality.Cons: They have a serious issue of bluetooth connectivity. And that\'s kind of a deal breaker, because it is very annoying for any given headphones. That is the only downside to these headphones, other than this it does pretty well at it\'s price point.Comfort: Being "on the ear ", they can be a little uncomfortable over prolonged use, but to help it, JBL has done a pretty good job at the ear cushions, very soft cushion rings wrapped in a leather like, soft to touch material.Build quality: These headphones are made of good quality of plastic which necessarily doesn\'t feel very cheap, however the housing of the wire, which runs through the overhead band, is not ver secure, the wire will start popping out after a couple weeks, which can be fixed with any adhesive tape, but that certainly makes it look ugly.Battery life: practically you get around 2 days of use on one full charge, which is pretty good for most people. Roughly 15 hours of playback time which you can get with a charging time of less than 2hours.A way better deal than OnePlus bullets wireless 2, except for that connectivity issue.\n\n', "\n\n  Pros:As listed by the company!! Works well!! I haven't tested out the battery life yet but the GOOGLE ASSISTANT was working flawlesslyMic quality was descent.Good for calls, but not that good for recording stuff!!Good Sound Quality!!Cons:The ear cup size is quite small! Not very comfortable for long uses!! Though fine for me, because of the cheap price at which I got it!!(Rs 1500)PRO TIP:Use the lightning deal option to save about Rs 500 for now!! Awesome headphones for Rs 1500.EDIT: Battery life is great!! Easily lasts 3 days on normal usage!!!\n\n", '\n\n  One definitely has higher expectations when it come to JBL, well this one is just about average.I will divide this review into 2 parts: Music Listening & Audio CallsMusic: The sound reproduction is ok. The bass is definitely pronounced when you switch from normal. Nothing exceptional when compared with lower priced brands (eg. Boat).Audio Calls: The mic picks up all noise in the environment around you... even the wind! The other party cannot hear you clearly. The bluetooth keeps dropping off during calls and one has to re-pair / restart to get connected again. This is quite frustatingBattery Life: This is the only good thing going for this.Other pains: the mode change / power on / off & other alerts are quite loud and annoying esp if you are using it while going to bed. It will wake up others in the room. The ear pads are a bit too small for my ears & the over the head strap too tight... my ears begin to sweat post 30 mins of using this\n\n', "\n\n  Just recieved the product today and happy to find the headphones to be of excellent sound quality and build. I primarily bought this for music and I was sceptical of using this for calling purpose, but it's turned out to be very good in this department as well. The caller at the other end could not make out that I was using a Bluetooth device. As of now can strongly recommend this product. Will update more after a month of usage.\n\n", '\n\n  The infinity job 510 is a great buy under ₹2000 I bought it for 1699₹ it has great battery life charging speed is good but I wouldn’t recommend it for long use as it gets uncomfortableIt can be folded which is good for portabilityThe connection range is good and it has good latency and performanceNow the sound quality isn’t great its loud but it’s better than average at this price point which I guess is goodThe noise cancellation is not much as it mentions to not have inbuilt noise cancellationThe build is plastic and feels quite ok tho one thing is great it has matte finish so doesnt become a fingerprint magnetHonestly if you are looking for a casual use great battery life headphones under 2000 this is a great buyUpdate : right side stopped workingHad gone to the service center and they said they will deliver in a weekUpdate 2: it took over a month for them to deliver the replacement it works fine\n\n', '\n\n  इस प्रोडक्ट का मूल्य देखते हुए इसको एक बेहतर प्रोडक्ट कह सकते है इसमें निम्नलिखित गुण और अवगुण है।गुण- ध्वनि की क्वालिटी काफी बेहतर है  बॉस काफी हद तक आपको संतुष्ट करता है  वजन काफी हल्का है  काफी देर सुनने के बाद भी यह हैडफ़ोन  आपको परेशान नही करता कानों के लिए  काफी आरामदायक है  बैटरी बैकअप सबसे बेहतर है  ब्लूटूथ 5.0 बेहतर कनेक्शन देता है।अवगुण...  प्लास्टिक मटेरियल बहुत अच्छा नही है  बॉस मोड आसानी से एक्टिव नही होता\n\n', '\n\n  Woaoooo...1.

Still waiting for response.Recommended Strongly to buy this product if you are looking for Battery backup upto 20Hrs. No issues with product.Am Happy @1299 price.\n\n', "\n\n  I have purchased this legendry device on 13th july it was delivered on 14th and I am writing this review on 23rd july. Count the days, now what I want to tell is I am using this headphone since 14th. I used it for calling in office. I used it for listening music, a lot of music and sometime my family used it as well. When it arrived it's battery was 80% and you know what I haven't charged it at all yet but still after all above usage its battery has been depleted to 50%, means 20% only in 9 days approx after all above usage. I am literally waiting for it to discharge but it seems that it's battery do not want to discharge at all. It has been equipped with super moster battery and extremely beautiful speakers. It is jbl infinity and there is no need to share it's sound experience as everybody knows it already. It has got truly beautiful sound. I mean yeah some people might say that it's bass is weak but trust me it is not. Even you will get all equal sound in it. I mean there are some headphones which have bass only and people love it. They don't experience other things like clarity, treble level etc. I was in doubt by those all negative reviews but I am more than extremely satisfied with this product and I will purchase more of these models soon.\n\n", "\n\n  Using it from last 3 days and the sound quality is amazing.JBL PRODUCTS ARE AMAZING. They have never failed me starting from my home speakers,to my wired headphones to Car Audio. These headphones are way good for the price.*The Bluetooth quality is super awesome and I can leave my phone on 2nd floor and roam the 1500ft 3 floored house without any disconnect.*As advertised the battery lasts well over 9 hours with regular use and takes about 1 hour to charge.*There is not much noise, the mids and lows are well balanced. The highs are perfect with no shriek.*I use it with my laptop as well.*The microphone is surprisingly good unless you are murmuring. I can take phone calls.* For the price this comes at the build quality is amazing.Cons:Not really just nitpicking or maybe a point to improve on next model* The button springs are noisy. Could be better with rubber padding*Could have more voice over options like battery low, connected, calling, battery level is 30% and all.*can't connect both devices (mobile and laptop) at the same time. Not a big deal. But a true value addition.\n\n", "\n\n  These have an excellent battery , worth the price. The sound quality is good, I find the BASS too much and some details missing, but they are satisfactory. I don't know why these are designed so BAD, the fit is very tight /small (PS - I do not have an abnormally large head! ). The max I can use them for is like an hour or so, and that's because my ears will pain a lot after that. I wonder why this design has stayed for years even when so many people have this fit issue!\n\n", "\n\n  Although the build is completely plastic, it is good quality plastic. Likely to be durable. Comfort is decent. Not too great. The cup size should have been bigger.The dual EQ mode is useless. I don't know why someone would use the high bass mode. It's unbearable to listen to.Didn't test the battery but I believe the claim of 72 hrs to be somewhat true. The battery was the main reason I bought this thing.The mic quality is amazing for the price.When I visited the harman website to register the warranty, there were only 2 options. To register blue or black versions of glide 510. I don't know why there's no red version listed on the website.Edit: There's an annoying tinny sound on when you press the right speaker. These get uncomfortable to wear after a couple of hours. Not unbearably uncomfortable but quite uncomfortable.\n\n", "\n\n  Best sound quality (including bass and clarity of sound) at this price range. (I suggest, to get best quality experience don't raise the volume more than 80%).I have Boat headphones as well which are undoubtedly worthless in comparison to this one.I think Harman/Kardon is the reason for it's quality otherwise JBL offers basic things at this price range which carry no exceptional quality for comparisons.I felt no hardness or tightness while putting on the headphones for around 2 hours.Plastic quality is also great and gives impressive look in black(golden infinity logo looks sexy in black). I didn't like other 2 colors at all as they doesn't have true color quality and looks shady.I shared this set with my friends and they had to agree with its qualities.It truly makes a difference with deep bass feature, appreciated.I strongly recommend\n\n", "\n\n  ATTENTION:So I was previously using Sony MDR XB450 for 1year and then Sony MDR XB550AP for 2years ...the reason was those headphones had the best sound quality in their price range at that timeSince Sony stopped manufacturing them and went for 10k-20k segment, I was very disappointed until I found about this Headphobe I'm Business Insider India pageRight off the bat ...best sound quality in both normal and deep bass modes...Sounds really similar to those affore mentioned Sony headphones but very very cheap..cuz 450 was 2.5k and 550ap was 3.5k from Sony..while these were less than 2k ...which is amazing ....Comfort is average...headphone is very compact and eventhough its plastic . It's very sturdyI 100% recommend it\n\n", "\n\n  I bought this primarily to connect with my TV for viewing it without disturbing others in the house. Pairing is simple. Connects easily with the fire tv stick. Audio quality is good. There is no lag between audio & video. When not worn, the sound is audible from the headphones.Build quality is basic. made of plastic only. no cushion on top /head rest. Ear pads are soft. however prolonged wearing can cause some irritation due to the pressure on ears.The dual equalizer mode wasn't noticeably different for me. Overall serves the purpose for which I bought it.\n\n", '\n\n  At this price you would hardly get any bluetooth headphone better than this. Audio quality is superb. Bass is mind-blowing. Battery backup is unparallel. You have to buy it to experience how long you can go with one charge. Practically the charge does not drop. The only problem is fitting issue. I did experience pain after prolonged usage. But gradually with proper scale size you will get accustomed to this. I can say now it feels comfortable enough for long usage. But this will not feel as comfortable as Boat or Mi or Sony though. That is the only drawback. Otherwise Infinity Glide 510 is the best bluetooth headset under 2000.\n\n', '\n\n  I first purchased this Item on the 2nd of July. It was promptly delivered and was a perfect and quick starter without any nagging issues. The output from the left side stopped after about a week. AMAZON promptly delivered a new piece and picked up the defective one in about 10 days when I placed a replacement request on the 12th of July. Today it is 12th of September and the same issue cropped up in the replaced unit. There is no sound coming in from the left side of the headphone. My review of the product is " IT IS A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT WITH QUALITY ISSUES. THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT IS A STRICT NO GO AND IS PERFECTLY FIT TO BE TAKEN OFF THE SHELVES OF AMAZON STORE" DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL. If you still want to buy one, Trust your luck and not the product.\n\n', '\n\n  Best sound quality and decent noice cancellation. Best suited for music/videos and Work calls as well.

Good battery life.\n\n', '\n\n  I am really much satisfied with this product everything is awesome apart than bluetooth gets disconnect intermittently overbthe call, after reconnnect call is not getting resume, You have to switch over phone/spekar in this case actual purpose of hands free call is not achieve.I have requested to replace the part. I hope replacement device will not trouble me like this.Apart than this issue, this product is awesome, Sound quality, Bluetooth connection range and Battery is really awesome.\n\n', '\n\n  For a music lover who has been using Bose headphones for a long time I can confidently say that my ears deserves better than this headphone.Ear pains after listening to music for sometime even with low volume level.I have tried some real bass music and trust me this headphone just farts noise beyond certain volume.Bluetooth keeps reconnecting sometimes and it\'s not the fault of the player device.Battery backup is good though. I use it only to attend voice calls.My suggestion after using for almost a year:If you can limit the usage for voice calls and for lesser duration in a day and can\'t shell out more money then may be you can buy. There are still better ones out there.Don\'t fall for "excellent at this price range" kind of stuff.You need functioning ears till you die. Don\'t buy junk\n\n', "\n\n  This is a Harman Kardon brand ..Infinity products are worth the money. Bass effect is awesome. Excellent noise cancellation and good sound quality. The downside is the buttons which are not soft. You will need to hold headphones with one hand and press volume up,or down or bass control tp adjust. Battery life is exactly as promised and charges very fast . The ear cushion could have been softer..But this may be a personal feeling.. it might have been provided to ensure that headphones don't slip or fall even if you dance.I recommend.\n\n", '\n\n  this is an average product . you will get  good sound with  deep bass only in higher volumes . battery is ok  but when only 40 % battery is remaining it will continuosly remind you for "low battery pls charge" continously after every 10% and the video also doesn\'t pause when it reminds you for low battery so that audio part gets skip for 2-3 sec. so you will have to rewind that video part again and again. this is the biggest drawback i have found in this product . hope jbl will improve it\n\n', "\n\n  I missed the return window else I would had returned it. Lets start with CONS as I don't see effective PROS in it:1) Extremely loud sound, it's not like it has good bass. It has terrible bass and these are just cranky loud2) Microphone may be good but you won't be able to hear other side properly as sound will be continuously echoing. Unable to take office calls from it3) Distort in sound seen  while listing to music, there will be continuous and frequent distorts4) Bluetooth signals may be slow, as while watching video, sound and image sync mismatch is seen5) Excessively tight on head, ears will pain if you wear it more than 15 mins.6) build quality is very cheap, when you press buttons you will get sound like we use to get in old style switch boards. These button pressing sounds will make you realize even wiring or material used inside  headset is of cheap quality7) Cost of 1800/- INR is not justified. You will end up just paying for brand tag of JBL which is nowhere written on headset as that is used just for marketing purposes. Ideal cost for this quality should be no more than 500 bucks.Go for Boat, Boult or other headphones if you are looking for budget headsets. This is just waste of money.Pros: None except for 1 year warranty. Since return period with Amazon is over I will try to exchange it with service center. I am not hoping much difference post exchange also but may be sound distortion during music could be fixed. Tht too i am not sure off just hoping.\n\n", "\n\n  It's a terrific purchase, best part is that battery ad you get whats been promised battery lasts for almost 2+ weeks in single charge, Bluetooth sometimes creates issue on skype calls while connecting with my system, not sure if that's a common issue or its only happening with me.Overall I strongly recommend to go for it.\n\n", "\n\n  These gave me a severe headache as soon as I started using them. I feel they were too tight and small for my ears which could have lead to headache.I was able to return themI used it to take few calls, mic was good and had no problem. I would have kept them if I didn't had headache issue.\n\n", "\n\n  As expected this is a nice product. I heard the music from boat rockerz 400 and from my friend. It has a louder sound than jbl infinity and almost no noise cancellation feature. The sound could be clearly heard to the outsider. Infinity has a satisfactory noise cancellation capabilty even not complete but okay at this price range. I would like to give 5 star if it would have a wired feature like boat rockerz. Battery back up is good. I have tried for four hour continuously with 90% volume and sure it would  go more. It is light  weight and the most  important  thing the ears don't pain much like boat rockerz. There is only track skip but no track forward option.  Once  folded  it could be kept in pant pocket. Bluetooth  connectivity  is amazing. It connects within  one sec and with obstacles like two rooms away it is working perfectly  okay. Without obstacles it is working up to 30m or about 100ft distance. Overall  I Will recommend to buy in this budget  range and will keep it above boat rockerz  series. The delivery  guy demanding me cash and not agreed to do any of the available  online transaction method like ATM card swipe, Amazon pay, net banking  or any other payment system which was so strange. In fact later this problem  was not there with that delivery  guy. But this happened  only after objected it strongly.\n\n", "\n\n  One sentence. Waste of your money. Dont go for this product. Yes can take calls and listen to music.Here's the story. When this headset has got a mic why cant i record a voice recording. Mic is only for taking calls but not for doing anything else?? Was it too hard wrtie a patchwork to use for all purposes.I have connectivity issue. While i am already on a call, when i try this headset it does not automatically pick up from there. I had to disconnect the call and place the call again for the headset to understand that i am making a call. Hmmm. Ridiculous.Bluetooth connectivity is decent. Bass is worst. Not many equalizer options. Deep bassss is horribleeeeeeeeeeeeeee. Fuze pint is faarrrrrrr better.Battery backup of 20 hours as marketed is only when it is connected ideally. When in use it hardly supports for 4 to 5 hours. I listen to 1 hour sets. When charged completely it might supports 3 sets max. Such a shame. Infinity clearly failed this product.I clearly donated my money to you guys. Cheap chinese products give better products than you. Clear disappointment.\n\n", '\n\n  Pros - Light weight, Good looks, Freedom from wire, Quickly auto pairs, Audio clarity of calls for people listening to you, Easy to operate buttons, long lasting battery back up.Cons - Audio starts cracking once battery goes down to 30% and below, Bass not deep, button operation leads to a click  sound.Overall - May be better options available!\n\n', "\n\n  Pros:1. Decent Padding which helps in noice cancellation2. Amazing Battery Life more than 72hrs in daily usage3. Connects easily with all devicesCons:1. Plastic Quality is not that good it has become so loose in 2 month average usage that seems like it is 2-3 year old headphones2. Bass is there but it is not the quality bass it seems like artificial bass when switched to bass mode and in normal mode the music quality is good but it definitely lacks bass, so bass implementation is not accurate.3. Padding should be a bit bigger coz will not fit everyone medium size ear will only fitConclusion: Please don't go with this earphone it doesn't worth the money until its price is under 1500Rs if you get it below 1500 in some offer than its good else don't spend any amount above it coz it's not worth, also if you like normal music with out much bass then only consider this headphones as bass mode is not executed properly\n\n", '\n\n  I have been using those for 4 days now and the battery is still quite full after using them 2-3 hours a day.The sound is crisp, there is a good bass without being overpowering and I can actually use them at medium volume on my phone without sacrificing sound quality.They are comfortable enough to wear for a few hours and the noise cancellation is quite good, I needed something to drown the background noise of being in lockdown with family while listening to music or working with sound on my laptop and it delivers.The build is good too, you feel they are quality and they rest nicely on my ears.\n\n', "\n\n  These are the headphonea to go in the range of 1500INR.

So they have this new range of affordable earphones and headphones and I was super excited. It took me little longer to order this because of some bad reviews on YouTube. But when I received this package I am not even 1% disappointed with the purchase. The sound quality,bass,built is perfectly fine. It doesn't give cheap look at all and it's a must buy product if you are looking for budget Headphones 🎧🤠.\n\n", '\n\n  I’m writing this review after using the product for 6 months. Primarily I bought this to conduct my online meetings using WeBex, Teams, Zoom, Google meet etc. I am happy to tell that it served the purpose brilliantly. There were no complaints of my voice being unclear at other end or no such issue that I could not hear properly other person. Calls are smoothly conducted. Off course, the music lovers might not like it. I am writing some Pros and cons as below:Pros:1. Absolutely superb battery life: Once charged, it runs for weeks, To be precise if I use it 3-4 hours daily it’s battery goes on of at least 2 weeks.2. Call quality is brilliant; however, it is not true noise cancelling device but it gives satisfactory results.3. Light weight and easy to fold and carry.4. Durable body.5. Quick charge really works, after charging for 1 hour it gives you week long battery life( daily 4-5 hours usage).Cons:1. Average music quality, not extra ordinary bass, or equalizer. It gives crisp and clear output and serves your average need of music listening. If you are looking for extra detailing with noise cancelling and true bass then you have to go for upper market devices.2. There are reviews about pain on ear after using for longer, that is true if we do not set it properly on our head, still after using 2 hours straight it might give you pain on ears.3. As I mentioned in Pros section that it has durable body, it goes against it’s looks, so if you are looking for stylish and rich looking headphone then this is not for you.4. Slow to connect; o any device be it laptop or mobile, it connects very slowly, many times auto connect fails and manually we need to connect it.\n\n', '\n\n  It is a very good headphone at a reasonable price. Looking to its price it is good. If you compare with MI headphones,MI is more comfortable for long use.Here sound is better, clear and loud. Option for deep bass is good.Build quality of MI is not upto the mark. My volume rocker is not working and MI does not repair it after 6 months.Hope infinity prove better.So far so good. Fully satisfied with infinity headphone.\n\n', "\n\n  Looks elegant... Bought the red color.Its completely wireless...

I dont have any use for the Dual Equalisers but if i want to make an elderly hear something i simply switch it to the equaliser setting to the low bass option so tjat they are comfortable hearing what they hear, but i feel someone who is into speeches and audiobooks the low base equaliser setting would do good for them...for me im sticking with the bass...The only thing i wished these had were Dual Device pairing and 40mm drivers, this would have Killed anything hands down, but for the pricing and the features it offers like specially Quick Charge, this is already a winner in my books.\n\n', "\n\n  Bluetooth reception is not good, some time connects easily-some time not. did not worked for my lenovo mobile connected but sound drop/break within a frequent span. noise cancellation not checked. sound is ok but what if does not connect fine. 1 star for bass as I don't like much bass for earphone, if bass is provided then bass control should be there. overall not satisfied with with this product of JBL-???, at last wold like to say beware of chinese product whether it is owned from famed company- SORRY\n\n", "\n\n  The battery is really good and long lasting, if you are a call person and you have to attend meetings frequently, you won't b disappointed buying this.I observed few connectivity drops using it with my laptop.

Somehow, no matter what, they never slip or feel uncomfortable even after hours of use.*The Bad*Not sweatproof, but at this price I'm willing to risk it.Compared to my Marshall Majors, Sound quality is actually better! But being Infinity, has to come with BIG BASS. Great, but sometimes wish it came with a Bass OFF switch 💭Bling logo could have been a big smaller.*The Ugly*Worst part for me is the buttons that make a horrible ting-ting sound on pressing.*Conclusion*Overall, despite being a first gen product, the Good triumphs!

Bluetooth connection and battery life are above to those offered in this segment.After using it for more than a month I've noticed that the bass is amazing but it was at a cost of cheap/poor build quality, after a month usage i am hearing a buzzing spring sound when there is a bass drop or you tap on right side of headphone.Overall sound note is good but for bass lover under 2k segment this one is for you, but be careful about build quality.\n\n", '\n\n  The best feature is the battery back up. The bass can be a bit overwhelming and hence best played around 75% volume in that eq mode.The plastic body seems fine and sturdy, but looks quite average.

I am saying this as after returning this one I purchased one of a different brand and know the difference. Now the question is why did I return this headset if sound was too good. The only reason to return is it is too tight on ears. Outer ears start hurting just in 5 mins and that was the experience of everyone in my family as I bought to be used with treadmill in this corona time for some home workout.

Call quality and noise cancellation is satisfactory, who cares until the music is heaven to your ears with this.\n\n', '\n\n  I bought this headphone becoz se it was lightweight. So I thought it will be comfortable as well. But when I used it I realised that the EAR CUPS ARE SMALL. It is very tight and squeeze your ears. It is not comfortable. It also creates a sort of vaccum inside your ear so you have to keep of adjusting the headphones from time to time. I cannot use it for more than 30 minutes. I have to keep on adjusting the ear cups because they start paining after few minutes. I tried rotating the ear cups but still not much improvement in comfort.Some pros areBattery life is good .

If you have a call outside then it might be very noisy for the other person on call,although u can hear clearly as this headfone gives good isolation on ears. Mic is omnidirectional.Bass mode is useless,its too much bass and not very well balanced so even bass lovers may not like it,normal mode has big enough bass. May be jbl can remove this feature and add multiple device BT connectivity.Major issue,may be deal breaker,it doesnt give multiple device connectivity, atleast 2,if i use it with tv and fone.i have to keep changing from one device to another,i guess that is a major  issue for me.Tip:For music listeners,airtel wynk music has best quality audio,better than saavn/gaana.this headfone was so bad on saavn that i wanted to return but i tried with wynk and its great. Gaana has been so bad that i stopped using it long back.\n\n', '\n\n  Really I love this. Listening even at half volume is so good to enjoy the music. fits right at your comfort. Adjustable size.

But it does a good job of keeping unwanted noise out (you can hear traffic or a pressure cookers whistle through the headphones but you'd blissfully unaware if your doorbell ever rings).Bass quality is so-so but the audio quality is crisp and clear.The only downside is that the headphones can become a little uncomfortable to wear after a couple of hours (especially of you're wearing piercings).\n\n", "\n\n  Pros:1. Very good bass, as advertised.2. Passive noise cancellation - as soon as you put these on, half of the background noise gets suppressed.3. Amazing battery life : I had to charge the headphones today, i.e. 10 days after buying them. And I have used them daily for around 1.5-2 hours.Cons:1. Since the passive cancellation is good, you may not feel comfortable wearing them for too long. But eventually you will get comfortable.2. Bass is good but rest of the notes aren't that good (they aren't bad either). This can be corrected by equalizer settings.\n\n", '\n\n  Its very light on the ears with great sound and bass. Good for casual listening to the songs, watching movies/series etc. Also good for outdoor jogging except you may find sweat irritating while using it for long time outdoors.

Also, most of the headphones in this range have major issues with mic, but it works pretty good in this headphone and only minor improvement area is 2 -3 second lag in delivery of message to other side, but overall it serves my purpose.

Despite being on ear , it's little big. Though not exactly over ear either. Insulates well. Bass does feel too much sometimes. Hard to tell difference between two modes. Build quality is top notch. Buttons feel solid. Though donno about lonegitivity. Had no pairing issue with mobile . recommend charging is 5v 1amp. Has no aux port.

It gave most 2-3 days of battery backup, after full charging. It's perfect for office calls, webinars, etc. Person on other side also gets clear sound if u r not in very noisy environment.When it was new, it was tight on ears, but it's fine now.

Waste of my money.\n\n', '\n\n  Good sound quality came with 80% charge. Bit tighter than my Sony Xb headphones but feel it will loosen up with usage. Red colour is good too, not girly red as you can see in pics. Comes with charging cable and quick start guide. By default it was on extra bass mode. Modes can be switched by pressing vol + and vol - key on the headphone together until the voice "normal mode / extra bass mode" is heard. On my Xiaomi phone it shows battery level both when first connected (as toast notification) as well as in notification bar under Bluetooth icon - which is very useful. User guide advices not to use chargers above 5V so make sure you check the rating as some fast chargers may damage the device. Overall good. Only slight negative is that button press is not quiet - mechanical button press sound is quite audible - it\'s like something rattling inside - spring movement maybe but not an issue for me a I don\'t frequtly change the volume settings.Quite happy overall as these are my first Bluetooth headsets and pretty good for the price.Been using them for 3 days for around 4 hrs total seen 20% drop in battery.

There is no pain on ear lobes even prolonged usage. The battery back up is up to the mark.\n\n', '\n\n  Expected a way better quality product.

I use it for about 10-12 hours n still get 5 days.- Build quality is good too.- Value for money definitely.Cons:- Ears start paining after 1.5-2 hours of use. This is a huge drawback though. Despite the headphones having so many pros, this one con makes it impossible to use it over 1.5-2 hours at a stretch. Defeats the entire purpose!Note: I remove it for 10-15 min after 1.5 hours use n then use it again.

It Fits comfortably on your head after slightly adjusting headband . Foldable , swivel earcups makes carrying it easy. Sound quality is above average. Sound produced is so impressive in normal mode that you will not feel any need for deep base mode.  Noise cancellation is passive but works for all usual , not so noisy environments.  Optional aux input and battery life announcement is missing but enough to compromise on all above advantages.Overall verdict: Just go for it. You will hardly find better choice. You may have to regret if you wait more.\n\n', "\n\n  Have been testing this for the past 18 hours and TBH these are amazing 'for the price'.Sound is calibrated beautifully to cater the Indian Audience.Pros::1.Good bass control,neither high thumping nor muted thumping.2.Good mids and highs and lows.3.Volume audible even at 10%.4.100% doesn't have distortion but not recommended as it may cause health issues.5.VLC player 200% boost causes screeching sounds,hence not advised.(unless you're a mad lad)Cons::1.Foam takes time to adjust on ears,it feels like something is pressing onto your ears.Although headband has no cushioning,still head doesn't pain even after long use.(headphone can be extended so nothing presses onto the head)Overall,a good buy given the low price but awesome quality.Battery life hasn't been tested yet but it's long,ultra long.Got it for 1.3k during the Infinity sale.(16-21Dec,2019).Harman Kardon did a good job!\n\n", "\n\n  I have been using this product and had one doubt about it not having the 3.5mm AUX connectivity, but the kind of battery backup I'm getting on this it's truly amazing. As per the claim it says 72 hours, but I have been using it for a long time now and I can definitely say that this claim of 72 hours is 'incorrect', its definitely more than that but the volume needs to be at an economical level, like 50% which as per me is enough unless you are someone who likes music at the loudest volume.The sound quality is definitely the best for the price it retails for and the bass is definitely better than the competition.Anyone who's considering this headphone or someone looking for a headphone in this price range I would suggest them to just go ahead and make the purchase. You wont regret it\n\n", "\n\n  Very poor quality.

So finally I choose this and ordered, it came within 3 days and started using it since 4 months.Sound Quality is Good. But not great.Connectivity is Super fast.Build Quality is Fine, it could have be better.Mic, If you are sitting in a room or home is fine. It wont workout in crowded areas.Finally Battery, Its mind-blowing. I charged my head phones just 3 times in 4 months. I'm moderate user (4 to 5 hrs in a day). Its really fantastic. Only this part is saving infinity from the other brand products.But Size is less, it wont fit for all types of head sizes. Its main drawback.And I have seen some reviews like ear paining and not comfortable. But it depends on head size, the way they keeping the weight on the head/ears. For me its quite comfortable, I am using continues for 3 to 4 hrs without ear/head pain.Final Verdict, Go-ahead\n\n", '\n\n  Build quality - averageSound - amazingBattery - easily last 4-5 daysCharging - 1 hrCons1.

Mind you I use Viper4android which is the most powerful equaliser for Android. But this headphone is absolutely on spot with sound quality. I tried 30+ profiles and found out that headphone quality is so good I don't need to use any profile.I loved everything else like controls, looks, comfort etc. The sound quality is what matters to me anyway.Edit : Its been 23 days since I purchased this product. I charged it fully on that day and today it has come to 20% with low-moderate usage. It took some days for me to adjust the headphones to my comfort while wearing them. You don't feel pain if you wear them right but you will if you don't make appropriate length settings.The range is very good. I can easily roam around 25 metres without getting disconnected. The mic is excellent and delivers clear sound during calls even if I speak low.Deep bass mode is excellent and doesn't affect clarity. You'll definitely get the DJ feel if you have bass heavy songs. You'll feel the vibration in the earcups when you turn the volume high, they are so good.\n\n", "\n\n  Bought this on a whim....After exactly 4 months of heavy use, here's my pro's and cons list:-Pros:- Lightweight. Only now starting to feel the weight....can use for hours without feeling pressure and pain on the earlobes.- Durable. I use it heavily....from morning to sleep time. Heck most of the time I sleep while wearing it....safe to say despite multiple falls and misuses, it still looks and works like day one.- Noice cancellation:- pretty good. Both out and in. Sometimes I need to put em down just to figure out why everything outside is so quiet. Moreover I can binge watch Grand Order without anybody being the wiser.- value for money. I have used 5k headphones too and I was clearly not aiming to use this headphone for long. Now it's a part of my life...too good specially considering the money.Cons:- Volume. I prefer this model cuz I can bring the best out of it...that may not be the case for others. So if u r someone who likes hearing things at brain exploding volumes....then u may wanna look elsewhere as max volume for this headset is a little below such intensity.- Bass. Kinda the only bad point. I don't really feel the difference unless the volume is maxed out. So I keep it at Bass On mode 24x7. Though once I connect it to my smart TV. Then it's golden.\n\n", "\n\n  It's a good product for music listeners. Good value for the price I paid for it. But my head size is a bit large, so it becomes uncomfortable for me to wear for longer durations. Starts hurting my ears.Pros:1. Good sound quality.2. Range is excellent. I've been more than 10 meters away, still good.3. Battery backup and charging time are exactly as advertised. Amazing.4. Very sturdy and robust. Won't break easily. Mine have fallen quite a few times, still intact.Cons:1. Not fit for taking calls. If it's a normal call, the other party will have a hard time hearing you. If it's over the internet (Skype, Teams, Duo etc), there's a big, intermittent lag, which makes you sound like a robot. Other side won't hear you at first, and then it's a burst of output for them.2. If your head size is large, it would become uncomfortable, slightly painful, if worn for longer durations.Overall:Music lovers can surely check them out. Not for other purposes though.Hope this helps.\n\n", "\n\n  The sound quality is really good. The build quality is also good enough, though not not so strong and robust.  Its been 2 days since I have bought it and I have really had a great experience. Its totally worth the money. The battery specially is humongous!! It hasn't got down more than 10% in 2 days!! Noise cancellation is pretty good but not to a point of total shunning of the outside world. Bass is smooth and easy in normal mode . In the deep base mode, the bass increases but the sound quality suffers a little bit. Overall, the music is enjoyable be it with beats, or slow soothing song. Good balance b/w bass and treble is found ,just like in any other JBL device. Definitely, go for it.\n\n", '\n\n  Great product from JBL infinity.Pros :1. Deep bass enables us to have woofers in our ears2. Clarity rocks for 320kbps songs3. Charging lasts for more than 5 hours4. Voice control is awesomeCons:1.

This product has bass but I found it far behind my skull candy headphone. Even I couldn't recognize deep bass features as they are advertising.The mic is also good in this headphone.battery backup is also good.Initially you will find it little tight on ear and bit uncomfortable.Overall a good product in this price range.If you want a good sound  quality then go for it.If you want a good bass then I think you should see some other headphone ( but those may be costlier in price range ).Reviewed after 3 day of use.\n\n", "\n\n  Its been 15 months and the headphone is working totally fine.Just 2 bad features of product:1) connecting issue- if it is connected with a device and Bluetooth is turned off it disconnects but doesn't connects new device until it is disconnected properly from bluetooth device option from the last device 2) its cover of the earpad cushion doesn't last longer as shown in pic and keep shredding everywhere the headphone goes\n\n", "\n\n  You must get it.. its value for money, the sound quality is the best.. remember it's from JBL, I stress tested the sound from several YouTube Dolby Surround sound 3D HD sound it and I am simply amazed.

I have been using this like since 2 weeks and I have charged it like 2-3 times only because my father just puts it into charge thinking it might have been used up but I have never seen its battery go below 70 percent . I usually use this for like 3 hours daily max .Sound quality is awesome. I won't say I have listened to music from high headphones but I am pretty avid listner and I can say it's very good . Has two modes and as I listen to both Rock and Soft and peaceful music both normal and bass mode serves it's purpose.The only Con is after few hours of use the ear lobes start to pain like not too much but it makes you take off the headphones or like atleast readjust .That's it overall the product is Awesome.My Rating 4.5 stars for the product0.5 stars extra for value for moneyI am a generous guy .

My soundmagic e10c has negligible bass and highs are harsh compared to these. I can hear sounds in music never heard in any of my previous headphones/earphones. The sound will not hurt your ears at any volume. As it has 36 mm drivers, in normal mode everything is balanced, there is ample bass, mids and highs. In deep bass mode not only bass is enhanced but mids and highs too. I listen to it in normal mode. Excellent for both music and movies, didn't try games yet. Excellent bluetooth range and connectivity with both my laptop and phone, connects in less than a second. Outstanding battery life for a bluetooth headphone : 72 hrs, didn't test it yet.

Bluetooth 5.0 is working better.6 And finally about the sound quality ----Bass is deep. But, it creates distortion also.Tips : Always try to listen music on Spotify. Because. Spotify always maintain -14 to -12 LUFS. So, when you are in Deep Bass EQ mode, try to listen on Spotify only. Otherwise, other players such like Youtube Music, Wynk, Gaana, JioSaavn, In built music player will give distortion as their LUFS threshold is higher than Spotify.Cons1. Slightly feels tighter.2.

Just a quick comparision for those want to buy one among these.1. Zeb Duke is a bit louder but that doesn't mean one can't enjoy music with Glide 510.2. Glide 510's microphone is better than that of Zeb Duke.3. Zeb Duke has aux support which is not present in Glide 510.4. Glide 510 has significantly more battery life than Zeb Duke.5. Zeb Duke has a gamer look with RGB lights and all the fancy effects. Glide 510 has a more professional kind of look.

Looking to return my order now.\n\n', '\n\n  I bought these Infinity by Harmaan headphones from Amazon Great Indian sale and I got one of the best deals.. The headphones are really good in all perspective..1. Talking about the sound, Infinity is offering one of the best product in this range as sound quality is really good.2. You get two sound modes ie Bass and Normal and you can easilly switch to a different modes.3. Talking about calling experience I have really had a good one.. My voice was pretty much audible to the listner. Also noice cancellation worked reallg well.4. Lookwise , the headphones really looks good and are comfortable on your ears with adjustable headbands which can easily be set as per your requirements. To give you a painless experience due to hard plastic ,It also contains ear cushions for long time use.5. Last but not the least, It is really easy to carry since you can fold them and keep it in your handbangs.All in all you can go for it without giving a second thoungt if you are looking something at this price range of INR 1000-2000.\n\n', '\n\n  Sound quality is ok, not bad not so good, frequency response abt 40hz to15k hz, not 20-20khz as mentioned, fits tight on head, may not be comfortable for long usage.There is very less different in bass quality of normal mode and deep bass mode. I think they shouldn\'t say it "deep". Maybe it is normal mode and bass mode.I purchased becs they claim upto 20Hrs playback time, which means for normal users it can go upto several days, and compact/foldable design.Only think I dislike is, they feel very tight on my head.\n\n', '\n\n  Very good sound quality, bass, and noise cancellationexcellent battery lifeBUTSmall ear cups, which starts to hurt after 30 mins if you are wearing specs, have to readjust\n\n', '\n\n  Build quality is OK in this price range. Pairing is smooth. Battery life is nice. There are two problems of course. 1. It hurts ear lobes after 5 min of use. 2. Treble is sub par. I mean high frequencies are suppressed due to heavy bass. Those who like balanced reproduction of complete spectrum will not like it. For me music is incomplete if highs are missing. If you are looking for a trendy headphone in affordable price range with slight compromise on wearing comfort and bass overpowering other frequencies, just go for this.PS. After a few months of use, I think I have started appreciating this headphone. Quality of aural diaphragms has improved.\n\n', "\n\n  Sound quality is over all very good, noise cancellation is better than average, don't expect too much bass in this. but it sounds decent bass and while watching movies bass effects you will feel ears shaking than listening to music but for some songs bass are shaking your ears you can feel powerful deep bass ofcourse it's definitely depends on quality of audio format battery backup very good nearly four weeks I charged it single time after I received package for more than a hour it's fully charged till now battery percentage is 50% overall value for money build quality also good less weight another important thing is I wear it continuesly for 3 to 4 hours it's very comfortable to wear it for long time listening while some headphones can't ware for long time like this headphone (infinity glide 510) I never feel pain or un comfortable for long time listening and it's best in class in same range headphones I am happy with this headphone\n\n", "\n\n  Well, I will tell you honestly, I did not expect much but I forgot that I was going for a Harman brand. We have the ConnectNext Audio System in our car which is made by Harman, and something which I really love for the quality, so I thought may be I'll buy it and see.The thing that highlights is: stereo separation, which is for me much more important than flat base, it provides a certain depth to the audio playback of any kind. I suggest using FxSound Enhancer virtual audio driver with it if using with PC for exceptional results. Charges at a convenient speed. Ear muffs are in fact a bit uncomfortable if used for longer hours, and I have glasses so it is entirely different deal for me.But at this price, I think one can't expect anything better. Not a fan of Boat, they are scammers, you would be stupid to opt for any other brand after Harman has entered the race.P.S. It just arrived today in the noon, if it is defective or gives problems in the future, this review will be positively updated in the favour of my fellow customers.Edit: I am using Dolby Atmos for Headphones with it and have no complaints at all in the sound section. However, it becomes really painful after usage of 1 hr., this is the only drawback I guess. I hope they keep working.\n\n", "\n\n  Don't fall for the unassuming looks or the smallish size. These pair of headphones definitely pack a punch. Lightweight, good sounding and at a really good price. THE best headphones to buy under ₹2000.Pros:1. Sound Quality: Best in class. Very good instrument separation, deep bass, clear mids and pleasant highs. Loud enough to listen at 60% volume most of the time.2. Soundstage: Often overlooked in this price range, the Soundstage is natural, with crisp tones.  Even audiophiles will like the Soundstage, considering the budget.3. Build quality: Although all plastic, the quality is good. Sim flexibility to fit larger heads, but overly very sturdy. Matte finis doesn't attract fingerprints and is easy to clean.4. Comfortable: The cushions are are slightly hard, but over time will become softer and more comfortable. No cushioning in the headband though. I've worn them for 5 hours straight and they did not have any issues.5. Lightweigh: Weighing in at just 130 grams, this does not feel heavy on the head and coin be worn for hours on end.6. Battery: I've never had to charge it until now. I've listened to about 15 hours in total and battery is still at 15%Cons:1. No Aux-in. Although sound is excellent anyway, having an aux in option would have resulted in even better sound, and an option when the battery runs out.2. Buttons, although easy to access, make a clicking sound when you're wearing the headphones.Overall, these are the best headphones in this price segment, MILES ahead of the bOAts and others.\n\n", '\n\n  Headphone is good sound quality...not too loud but quality is nice..dual equaliser function are great work first time i see in Bluetooth headphone....if u r want to listen quality sound go for it but if u want louder sound that is not for u.. overall personally i like this.\n\n', '\n\n  I have been using this for 6+ months now. Initially when I got it, I was satisfied for its sound quality as its really good. But the mic quality was just OK. I purchased this as I have to attend meetings so I can move freely while being a listener in the meeting but in between its mic used to stop working so I had to reconnect it which is a problem when you are in an important meeting. After 6months now, mic has stopped working. So I will not recommend it.\n\n', '\n\n  Could have served better with 3.5 mm Jack for wired connectivity. In wireless mode sound volume is low to moderate, in the sense you have to set the volume high. During conference calls voice breaks both ways. Ok for for watching news and listening to music. To overcome the conference call issue I had to buy a Blaupunkt headset which had bluetooth as well as 3.5 mm jack and is Rs 300 less. I have two instead of one because of conference call issues.\n\n', '\n\n  Best On the ear headphone under ₹4000.

Loud and clear sound with nice surround effect, the bass is punchy (even in normal mode) I didn't need to use deep bass mode.2. The mic is excellent for calling purpose.3. The headphones are light weight.4. The battery is impressive, headphones runs over a week in single charge for me.CON's: 1. Not a big con but a size of ear cup should be slightly more larger so the headphones can fit comfortable for the people who have big ears like me.2. The main con I find is the button quality the buttons feels cheap, they must improve it.\n\n", "\n\n  Update after an year, wasted after 7 months of use. My mom use this to watch tv during my call time. Sound quality is nice but It's not durable.Old review: I like softer side of treble and crystal clear sound with high sensitivity. Bass is good but not too overpowering. If you are someone who like Xtra Bass series of sony then this is not for you. But if you love to hear all details in a music, then this is for you. This review is based on two days of listening. I dont know if bass will improve over time due to burn in, but as of now its worth every penny of my 1700/- paid for this.\n\n", "\n\n  Really surprised n shocked to find this product to be this good , basically there are 2 modes in this , normal and deep bass , the deep bass mode is just dope and damn powerful , n here comes the best part which is battery , the battery lasts long for about 9 to10 hours which is too shocking , the battery standby is just at it's best , if u charge the battery full ( 2 hours ) then the battery lasts long as much as 30+ days which is really really damn awesome, overall satisfied 😁❤️.\n\n", '\n\n  Pros:Good Sound Quality,Bass is good when you turn on the deep bass mode,From a good brand like JBL,Good Battery Back up and connectivity,Cons:Build quality is just average,I found the size is very small and fits well on 5 years kids as well,Packing was average and most of the time this product will be out of stock.Sound quality is good but sounds leaks a bit, the person sitting beside you can also enjoy the music you are listening to.\n\n', "\n\n  I am using it for nearly a months and here's what to say about it.The sound quality is really impressive. It has normal and deep bass mode. The normal mode itself has some bass enhancement and the deep bass has a larger bass enhancement. Bassheads will love the deepbass mode but not the others. But the over-all sound quality is very good in the normal mode and the non-bassheads people will like it. The mic and noise cancellation is really good and impressive. Thumbs up for that. The major con here is the built quality.  It is fully made up of plastic and the buttons are really cheap. If you press the button when you are wearing the headphone you get the springynoise echoed in your ear and that is awful. And the battery life is a major pro is this headphone. You don't need to worry about the lack of 3.5mm jack. It clearly lasted for 3 weeks for me which is great. Since it is wireless it has latency and can't be used for gaming. Had a  great experience while watching movies. Overall a great budget headphone and definitely a go for it if build quality and latency doesn't matter for you.\n\n", "\n\n  Superb headset for office calls - (the primary purpose of my purchase).For Music lovers - you need very high quality files to truly enjoy the full dynamic range of these headphones - try both the modes - normal / deep bass. depending on your taste, you'll like either one. Enjoy! Battery life is also seemingly much above the average so far.... :)\n\n", "\n\n  This headphone is really good at the price point of 1500.1. It doesn't pain even if you use it for long. I saw one movie for more than 1hr 40 mins but it was all ok.2. The sound engrosses you completely in the movie and you just want to complete watching it.3. It has two bass modes but i found no difference between both of them.4. The volume is not high and they could have made it a little higher.5. Fit, finish packaging is all goodOverall go ahead and buy.Note..I have not tested noise cancellation.\n\n", '\n\n  The sound and usability of the headphones are good. The battery life is also decent, but long term usage need to be addressed.However, the headphones are not really comfortable. They pain your ears after a while of usage. So if you are looking for a comfortable long duration usage over the head phones, this is not the one for you...\n\n', '\n\n  Edit:Some serious flaw as the headset left speaker will not have sound. Replaced in warranty, but the replacement headset got same problem in 2 days.Sound Quality -I will rate 4/5. Bass and Normal mode both are good.

Wih dolby digital and this bad boy gives proper sound experience. Bass is too heavy when eq boosted, normal eq is just mind blowing. Very real sound output from a headphone at this price, crazy work by Infinity, Harman.

That's almost unbelievable. But it's true. There are two Bass modes which is also a good option. Microphone is also good. The thing this product lacks in is the sound quality and noise cancellation. I will give 4/5 for sound and 4/5 for noise cancellation. Been using this from months. So I am writing all this with my using experience.\n\n", '\n\n  Battery super,Connective and range super (missing out connecting two diveces at a time :-(Mic is good and efficient in indoors.Noise cancellation is also great at 80% volume. I tried it with home theater on in the same room and could not hear hometheater sound at all while playing music with this one.Build quality OK, not best, not even worst. A decent quality, buttons sound quite cheap... but you will not find time to think about it with other so many goodies.Sound quality is super, initially the music was too bassy and highs were supressed, but after 1 - 2 days extenssive music play now its opened up and music clarity is super.Bass is good and dual mode provides you that extra bass as per your taste.Mid and highs are super and clear and the best part is that the extra bass is not impacting the mid and highs.instrument separation is also good enough.So at 1700 price its a real steal, even I would say it will beat many head phones in higher budget also.If you are looking for a BT Headphone, then simple go for it, with in 2000 budget.\n\n', "\n\n  A sub brand of JBL and it gives every feature in sound department.Though Build quality is plasticy but when u hold it in hands it doesn't feel that cheap.Battery backup is very gud, on single charge it's giving me around 4-5 days backup.Earcup size is comparatively small which makes it on the ear headphones 🎧 not i er the ear, but u dont feel any uncomforness on long usage.One thing I miss here is the oresence of 3.5 audio jack rest all is perfect.\n\n", "\n\n  Everything is very good in this headphone. Sound, noise cancellation, bluetooth range & connectivity, comfort and battery life etc are excellent. I've been using this since two days and yet 60% battery is left. Bass is gorgeous and heavy.If there is anything I'm worried about, its the build quality. I'll come back and give it five stars if the headphone survives for 6 months. It's not too bad. But I'm sceptical about it. A bit of metal could have been used in the hinges. Otherwise.. excellent product.\n\n", "\n\n  Writing this review after one month of extensive use!1) Sound Quality: My preference is mainly clear and silent songs. The sound quality for that is awesome.But, when it comes to pure bass songs, it lacks a bit.To sum it up, I would say that this is very good in sound clarity, but not very good if you are need to hear high bass.2) Battery Backup: It's just awesome. No other words needed. I charge it once in a week, and use it for almost 6-7 hours everyday, but still it does not drop below 20%.3) Great for Meetings: For WFH, I needed decent noise cancellation headphones. This is a perfect one for Zoom, Teams, Google Meet meetings.4) Comfort: At first, I was a bit uncomfortable while wearing it for long time. Felt tight to my ears.But, now it has loosen up a bit after one month, now it is appropriately comfortable.Overall Rating : 4.5/5\n\n", '\n\n  The headphone stoooed working exactly after 30 days. Switches off automatically within 10 seconds. Initially it informs when we powe on/off the device. I m giving 2 star only for the sound quality.Built and plastic quality is very cheap.

Rest is upto you.Note: Do check manufacturing date. It should not be less than 3-4 months from current date.\n\n', "\n\n  Receiver product today. I read so many reviews before buying Glide 510 and most of them have 5 star. I am also giving it 4 star. Reason I am not giving full 5 star is that there are few thing which can be improved in this headsest.1. The plastic quality is average and not that much good which was expected.2. Power on/off switch is of below everage quality and it slightly hard to press.3. There is no button to pick and disconnect the calls.4. My ears start getting pain after wearing it for more than 30 minutes. It's bit tight on ears.5. It's not foldable like other headsets. Only earcups can be foldable upto 90 degrees.Apart from above issues, rest everything is superb. Sound quality, call quality is awaesome. Person at the other end can clearly hear the voice loud and clear.Hope this review will be usefull fot other who are looking to buy this.

I bought red coloured headphone.1) The looks of this headphone are good. It is less sturdy, although not delicate. Built quality is satisfying, average, when the buttons on the headphone are pressed, it sounds "tonn" "tonn".2) The bluetooth connectivity is fast and reliable. When watching videos or listening music while one is sitting at a place, then best output, but if someone uses these headphones while commuting in crowded places like Mumbai, the sound keeps on breaking i.e. BT connectivity issues.3) Sound clarity is great, lows, mids and highs are clear. Bass is perfectly balanced, feel vibrations only when needed. But the volume feels a little low, also when watching movie in MX Player, volume decays a little more. It means this headphone finds beest indoor usage. May this not be a case with Netflix or Amazon Prime.4) Battery backup is great, apar from most of the more costlier headphones.\n\n', '\n\n  One rare product which performs exactly as stated in the product description.The battery backup is simply awesome and definitely lasts for atleast 20 hours, if used at medium to low volumes.Sound quality is awesome for a headphone  in this price range.

No pairing or disconnection issues.-In call quality of audio and the Microphone.-Battery : Even though I bought 500 model instead of the more expensive 510 which has 72 hours backup, I still am pretty impressed with the battery quality. 2-3 hours of continuous use only drains from 100% to 80%- Bass is decent & appropriate, not overdone at all in my opinion.- Over the ear cups are soft atleast until 2+ hours of use.Cons :The headband is plastic so might be fragile. If it breaks after day to day use after a short while, I might deduct a star.In breif at this point I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase.\n\n", "\n\n  reviewing the item after many days of use, PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS ITEM... initially the headphones were a bit okay, as it had minor issues of bluetooth disconnecting admist the call, it was frequent but not that much botherable, however over the period of time, the product performance went from being a bit good to worst... the blutooth disconnects automatically and doesn't connect again, issues while connecting the mobile/device to the product infinity (JBL) glide 510... feels like waste of money for the purpose it was purchased for, also there is no comfort while wearing it as the ears pain... now the situation is such that, the product doesn't connect the device readily and there is a lot of tussle that needs to be made, overall I would say the co. is making profits by fooling the customers, and thinks the customers can be fooled easily by sticking degraded and worst products to them... for a product in this range that is ₹1.3k, the sound quality is ok, you cannot expect noise cancellation, and the bass quality is also considerelable... problems do arise when you're on a call with somebody as well..... to sum up, overall a worst product after a few days of use... SO PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS, as it will not get connected to your device after a short period of time...\n\n", "\n\n  I bought this headphones to enjoy good quality and music, and man they do deliver on it!! One of the underrated option at this price segment,it punches above its weight.Pros:1.Battery backup (I haven't charged them yet,I use them atleast 2hrs daily)2.Range,they have good effective range.So you dont have to worry about jittery voice when you are moving around.3.Sound-Obviously the main thing it is supposed to do is sound good,and it does.I have tested songs from all the genre and they sound awesome for sure.You might feel some shrill at higher notes but overall its good.Bass is well balanced.Best in its price range and wayy better than the ones which have romped celebs to endorse mediocre products.4.Calls-works well for taking call.Other person can hear you good.You don't have to shout to make them hear you.Cons-To be honest,not many and they are not deal breaker1.Feel on ears:Not very easy on ears.Doesnt cover them whole.Hence you might feel some stress on the edges of ears where the pressure is felt.2.Noice Cancellation: Average on thisThing I will be interested in its life.

Its a STEAL.\n\n', "\n\n  This is my review after 5-6 hours of receiving the product.I have purchased it from Work from the Home perspective for zoom calls.Good Points:1) Call Quality is absolutely fine. I tested it on Phone call via smartphone, Zoom call via laptop. There is not any issue. But one of my friends said that your voice is having too high pitch and he needs to lower his headphone volume to cease this uneasiness during the call. Once he lowered the volume, everything was absolutely fine. I said to him to check the call at high volume in both bass boosted and normal mode, results were the same. But none of the other friends reported this issue. So it is maybe subjective to him.2) Noise Cancellation during the call was quite good. I deliberately turned my Fan on at full speed along with Windows AC to see if it picks up the background noise but all of my friends reported no issue of noise.3) Build Quality is good and plastic used is not the cheap plasticFew things which I didn't review yet:1) I haven't reviewed battery life yet.2) I haven't purchased it for the purpose of listening to music, so haven't tested.Few Negatives:1) Since these are on the ear and it exerts too much pressure on the ear, so you wouldn't be able to wear it for long hours. My calls are usually for half an hour to 1 hour and these should serve my purpose.Since I have not used it for very long time as of now, my review might change after usage.So, If anybody wants to know my experience after using it for long period, he can drop mail to pardeep.pk1333@gmail.com with Subject Infinity Glide 510 and I will reply to your query.\n\n", '\n\n  The product is of good built, but the main purpose of buying it was the bass and local clarity, which I expected from a Harman Kardon product does not exist, the bluetooth connectivity and range is decent, th noise cancellation is a bare minimum.\n\n', "\n\n  First of all its a made in China product, so buy it at your own discretion. I am fooled into this trap, I want to return this product now but Amazon does not accept return for this product. They can only replace with same product.If you are buying this for calling, don't buy, the call quality is below average I would say, you get very wobbly sound from the other side 99% of the times. I am not sure if thats the issue with my pair.However it gives a descent sound quality for listening to music. Battery consumption is very less. I am using this for past 2 days and it still have over 70% battery left.Nothing great about the sound quality too it's an average headphones.

Considering the small number of service centers, now I will need to travel 200 km to go nearest service station, and not sure will they accept this for warranty, or will I be able to get a good quality of sound or I am going to totally lose 1700 Rs, which I wasted in this product.\n\n', "\n\n  Hi. I got this product in 1299/- on 18th December. My friend spoke really highly about same and that's what prompted me to buy. Pros• Amazing battery life• Good sound quality• Good Bluetooth connectivity• Lightweight , foldableCons• No cushion on headband (but price makes that easy to ignore as plastic is good quality)* The only drawback that I really faced, and got it exchanged once too but unfortunately in vain: The right headphone on tapping has an aluminium sound (like a tunning fork). The easy way to ignore this is not to tap the headphone. But in my case, when i speak or someone else speaks loudly, the vibrations make that hollow sound. My ear being sensitive, I get distracted by that sound. I hope I get used to it. That's something that is not amazon /online retailer's fault. I called up Harman to ask if they knew anything about this but they were clueless too. I exchanged the first one thinking it is a 1 piece issue, but it is not. I do like the sound and battery backup. Hence, will keep second one.Full points to amazon and appario retail for immediate and hassle free exchange. I only wish this sound wouldn't be there.• Also, first one seemed very tight on ears. This seems a little better. I searched a bit online and initial 2-3 days there can be a little pressure on ears.\n\n", '\n\n  7 days back up according to my daily usage 3 to 4 hrs a day. bass is superb, sound quality is also superb and fast charging takes nearly 45 mins to get full charge the battery from 20% to 100%.

I highly recommend this product for long journey and those who always forget to charge their devices in time cuz of their busy life.... hahaha lol...\n\n', "\n\n  I've been using it for months now.i would say you could consider this one even if your budget is huge. Simply save your money.this is it.tough and rigid.fits easily.Very good backup.comfortable cushioning.Quite and isolating actually more than it should.They say quite low on bass but they just have to criticize something.if you love music you will love this too.decent amount of bass.trust me ,i have listened to most mid budget and premium headphones in the market,those loud bases are simply -stupid.some headphones are more like head massagers than headphones.i dont know why so much base is needed that even distorts the music heavily.This ones better than headphones costing around 5k fir reasonable differences.the listening experience is well satisfying. This one's from harmon and the sound signatures really convince you.its very cheap for its value.keep it even if you dont have to its a collectable.hope they bring more such good products.Thanks for reading.Leave a like so that i know you were here.And go for it.sure there are better headphones out there but dont think too much and save some of your money.Happy shopping!!\n\n", '\n\n  The first thing that comes to your mind after using this headphones is "great bass".Definitely worth the price.Pros:1.

Built quality is great as well.4. Wonderful battery. At 60% after a whole day of connection with almost 4 hours of playtime.5. Excellent bass. More than satisfied with the highs and mids as well. Very Clear understanding of lyrics. (I\'m a bass lover)Cons:1. No aux input so not for gamers. Latency is present in any bluetooth device. No latency mode present.2. Micro usb for charging is a downer. One more cable to look for.3. Hurts the ear a little after prolonged usage. Have to keep adjusting.4.

Harman wants a piece of the Indian budget oriented market and they're right. The bass is punchy but not too deep as a sony or a Skullcandy as i have owned both of them before but volume levels, soundstage and noise isolation is unmatched and far better than headphones that cost over 3k. For me this was an impulse buy and if you're looking for something from a premium brand on a budget then go for it. The build is plasticky but not too bad. Absolutely unbeatable for the price.\n\n", "\n\n  The headband is quite tight fresh out of the box. Make sure you wear it in so that it loosens up a little for a more comfortable fit. Good sound. No complaints received when using mic. Worth the price. Highly recommend for casual listeners on a budget but wouldn't recommend for bass enthusiasts.\n\n", "\n\n  I had searched a lot before going for this. There are some other options also such as Boat, Leaf, etc., but It have a signature sound. Go for it with close eyes. Even JBL's after sale service is excellent. They provide free home pick-up where they don't have service center. So don' t worry about its after sale service. Even this is the lighted only170gm of weight. Long day usage will not hurt anymore. It's cushioned are also very soft. In short full paisa wasool. Blue color looks like a Royal Blue color. Best for Airport visits and routine running or Attending official zoom meetings or classes also give immersive experience. 100% recommended.\n\n", "\n\n  I ordered this headphones by reading all reviews but know i m very disappointed 😥 my microphone is not upto mark.

I used it from 2019 and after 2 years it's cushion got damaged due to regular use. I was looking for light weight headphones and then i saw this one. This product is not returnable.

It only supports SBC and AAC profiles.\n\n", '\n\n  The product is exceptionally good in terms of the sound quality. It’s very light weight and portable and offers best in class battery backup of 20 hours which is amazing for its size. Noise cancellation is also at par. My first one had connectivity issues where it would disconnect automatically and the replacement I have received is perfect.A big minus I have observed so far is that the audio video sync when watching movies over laptop is bad. There is a slight delay in audio however it’s not noticeable when you are playing just audio. It’s when video comes in and you realise the audio is a bit delayed. Surprised to see such a fault from a brand like this.If you are only audio guy, go blindly for this but if you are planning to watch movies, then you might take a second thought.\n\n', '\n\n  Great till it lasted...but just after 3 months the left speakers have stopped working.

I love to listen to music.Coming to this headphone. I absolutely reccomend this to you at this budget no need to extend to 2k as it comparable to headphone being sold at that price point.Coming to this headphone, bass is really strong. Sometimes the high notes gets hidden due to the bass.  But the sound band is really wide and noise cancellation is really strong.  Few would say no 3.5mm Jack is a bummer but to be frank you bought this to use it wirelessly so this shouldn't be a concern as it also has really high battery backup. Give it 2 days of proper listening so that the speakers expands and give the sound at it's TRUE capacity.Its absolutely value for money. Another cool fact people would say it's made up of plastic that feels cheap. I didnt feel so it's absolutely fine and add to it light nature.. it's so light.All in all a high thumbs up to this.\n\n", '\n\n  Good headphone. Very useful for online classes. Clear voice.

Thanks to amazon for the prompt delivery.I would say, the headphone is one of the best at this price range. I have been listening to my playlists for the past two hours and after I tweaked the eq a little bit from my phone, the sound quality is just awesome. ( You might need to have to tweak your phone eq settings a little before you can find the sweet spot). Feels like listening through a top-end headphone. The deep bass and the clarity is amazingly good. Battery life seems good, considering I was listening for more than 2 hours, the battery meter still shows the same when I first turned it on. Hopefully, the battery life will deliver as claimed by Infinity. (72hours playback time).In between listening to music, I took a call and there seem to be no problem with the mic. The receiver at the other end could hear my voice without any problem. ( Although it doesn't have noise cancelling, it's good enough for indoor calls in  quiet environment). and there was no hassle with talking through the in-built mic. Also, the earcuffs are really comfortable and it wont pain your ears.The only downside is it doesn't have an aux jack option. But with 72 hours of playback time battery capacity, i dont really see the need for the aux port. The battery should be good enough to last for a week in a single charge.( will depend on how often you use the headphone)Overall, a great headphone to have.Thank you amazon.\n\n", '\n\n  Sound quality:8/10,Noise Cancelling:8/10(for its price),Comfort:7/10,Headband:5.8/10(plastic),No other brand can compete with this..As an audiophile, I loved the way this headphone plays the sound.  I tested this headphone with the app \'function generator\' to test how it manages the different frequencies. But it did well. As of lows, I managed to hear the sound till 7.5Hz(the lowest frequency). Highs are also fantastic.  As of my research, I noticed the concept of "Binaural Beats" which was going on in the sound it produced. I recommend you searching "Binaural Beats" in Google. This generates a kind of Binaural Effect(3D audio) as an output, which I felt somewhat. This is done by VLC in their software. So, I recommend you use the VLC media player with the equaliser set to Headphones. This enhances the sound\'s liveliness. This was my research with this headphone. Hope it is useful.  Just go for it.. This product is gonna satisfy you.. Cheers..\n\n', '\n\n  These are JBL, so quality is not an issue. The pairing with mobile was quick and effortless.

It lacks the trebble part of audio and it is noticeable even when compared to entry level JBL in ear earphones. Yet to see the battery backup.

Performance in deep bass mode is too good to believe unless you try that.Downside are the look and feel. Hard plastics, too tight on ears. Unless you're immersed in the movie, you can't help but feel the discomfort of wearing it.Overall it worth every rupee you pay for it.\n\n", '\n\n  I write this review after the completion of full power given by the company.PROSIt lasts for nearly 9 days for my regular usage (approx 50-60 hours).I received on 6/10/21 and i first charge on 15/10/21.battery backup is quite decent.Built quality also nice but not premium.becaz we cant expect that in this price range.nice matte finish on small area.Action movies gives you best bass experience.Mic works better.both sides are clean to hear while calling.Let come to CONS.3.5mm porrt is missing......Ear muff getting hurt your ears after few hours.every time we need to adjust it.Conversational movies gives you avg sound quality...Buttons are noisy while pressing.\n\n', "\n\n  I was looking for a headphone with a mic for WFH purposes. I went through a lot of feedback about people complaining about the mic.After using it for 7 days, I am sharing my review.For me mic is working absolutely fine, its just you need to know how to connect. I have connected it with my Dell laptop and its working absolutely fine. You may go through the attached pictures to understand how to connect the mic.For the rest of the feature,i am more or less agree with the existing reviews. Good sound quality, less noise cancellation but you can't expect much for an Rs. 1300 item.\n\n", "\n\n  I bought this for regular use. It can be used for taking calls and there has been no degradation in call quality on both sides. On top of that experience of listening music has been top class. It has balanced bass and the mids and trembles are also good. Have listened to instrumentals and really loved every bit of it. Just don't use the exclusive bass mode. There, all the good things about this headphone seems to fall apart. Battery is good too. On using it for about 3 hrs a day I did not require  to charge it for almost a week.\n\n", "\n\n  I have purchased  this product in July-2020 but after 20 days , it's not powering-up, no bluetooth connecting, finally product is scratched  for me.I was happy after a week, because1. Its giving more than 60hr backup2. Sound quality  is average or say good if backup considering.2. Noise cancelation  is also above to average.Cons.1. After 20 day it off permanently.2. As its warranty  is 1year but no response  from company... no idea where to find services  in covid-19.\n\n", '\n\n  Worst product, do not buy, never connects to Bluetooth after repeated efforts.

But believe me I used these headphones for more than 2 hrs for my online classes and no ear pain came. And coming to the noise cancellation, I experienced a better noise cancellation when outside and no noise will be heard when you are indoor. Overall I would rate these headphones 9 out of 10. And if you ask me for the cons, I personally did not find any cons but generally the head band has no cushioning making it feel a little uncomfortable. But you won't notice that much. And also I would rate it 10 out of 10 if the auxiliary cable feature is there as I generally play a games like pubg free fire alot. Overall it is a wonderfull headphone if you are looking a headphone under 2000₹. I used boat rockrz 450 as well as motorola escape 210 and comparing them with these headphones, I can give you hundred percent guarantee that these headphones are the best among the above mentioned in terms of all aspects except the auxiliary cable feature\n\n", "\n\n  I was promised an amazon prime subscription of 3 months for purchasing this product. I bought it on july 11. They said I'd receive the code within 48hrs. A month has passed and i still haven't gotten the voucher.

JBL straight up doesn't care about fulfilling their promise of the 'JBL combo offer'.Very Disappointed, i will never buy anything JBL again. Bad service.\n\n", '\n\n  The best headphones at this price that one can get very honestly speaking. Came across many reviews w.r.t this headphones on YouTube and on the web....Two most common flaws that people are pointing out particularly are that firstly, the headphones don’t have an auxiliary cable to connect to the phone or laptop when the battery drains out but I say “who the hell needs that anyway when you have 72hrs of playtime.” Now secondly people r complaining about the full volume. Most of them are saying that when u play it on full volume don’t expect it to b too loud u will be disappointed....but when trust me u won’t get disappointed at all unless if ua deaf or u hav hearing problems. It’s suffice for Normal earsLastly above mentioned are my honest review about the product. #classy and crisp sound#Deep and rich base#enuf volume for normal ears#soft & comfy cushion.\n\n', '\n\n  Review after 2months of useGreat budget headphones(while brand is from Harman, it’s not as superior as JBL or Harman). At this price point it 1.5k; you shouldn’t expect either. Decent purchase.Pro’sloud soundGood amount of noise cancellation is experiencedclear musicBass is fairly good (not for bass lovers though)Built quality is sturdy and durableConsLatency (audio lag) experienced especially in android devices(tried on my one plus phone, android set top box & Samsung smart tv). Works better with Apple devices (tried on iPhone, iPad and MacBook) with very little latency.Not meant for gaming like pubg, cod(on android only). Your game scores can go down :( due to audio latencyBluetooth Pairing - If you change device, you will need to pair each time you return to previously used devices. This is big let down as you have to pair each time. Bluetooth pairing ideally should be a one time setup.\n\n', '\n\n  I have been using this since 2 months and over all its a good one. No issues when connected to a mobile.But challenge is when connected to my MAC. Issue is I have when connected to Mac blue tooth, it doesnt connect immediately. I have to switch off the headset and switch it on for 3-4 times before It connects. I dont know if this is a issue with Mac models or something else. Would like to hear feedback from Mac users.\n\n', '\n\n  One of the best headphones in the budget category. Highlight is the battery.. single charge almost lasted for 10 days. Sound quality is also great. Initially there was discomfort since using headphones after long time. But after repeated usage, it was very good for continuous usage for both calls and music. Also I have not felt the plastic make to be awkward. To conclude simple and effective for daily use at an affordable price.\n\n', '\n\n  Being an Infinity brand of JBL, it meets the requirement of user.  Bluetooth connectivity is Excellent,  crystal clear sound and in normal mode also I am getting a good sound quality. Moreover, it is a budget friendly headphone so go for it.

Bass is low2. Causes ear pain after using it for 2hours continuously3.

Budget headphone, if you dont have any much expectations go for it.Good for new headphone users 😄\n\n', "\n\n  The annoying batter low warning in every 1 minute is so useless.I know the battery is low. But you can't use it below 30%Imagine not your car stopping every 1 minute when there is 30 percentage petrol remaining. It would be a pain.Not recommended.Stupid headphones. Makes me want to throw them.\n\n", "\n\n  Seamless connectivity. Excellent sound quality. My brother uses Bose and Sennheiser products who was really impressed with the sound quality in the first go. He couldn't believe I bought this superb product at a launch price of ₹1499/-. This was a good deal for me.I don't listen to very High bass thumping tracks, but I do give equal importance to vocals, lows etc. This headphone does a great job. It has a bass boost for those who want extra thump and effects. But that might damage your ear.Must buy if you want to stand out from the crowd who is stuck with regular JBL or boAt.\n\n", '\n\n  * Feel/look: overall look is good and is feather light with good grip but if you are a person with eye glasses then it may not be suitable for long time usage due to on ear.* Sound quality: better than good and i personally was happy.* Connectivity: easely connects how ever operations issues are there with multiple devices, viz. Airtel Internet TV settop box stops content streaming in Airtel TV app, amazon prime video, Hotstar & zee5 apps show similar characteristics. In other example when using with mobiles hands free mode after receiving calls some times doesnot carry sound of the person who has called.\n\n', '\n\n  Immediately after opening the cheap plastic finish put me off. But on connecting it to my phone the sound was surprisingly really good, especially considering the price. The high and low frequencies are pronounced, which is how I like it. The plastic material makes it incredibly light. So once I got reconciled with the finish, I actually like the headphones. It is simple and does not have too many other features. I would not use it to make phone calls.\n\n', "\n\n  You can't go wrong with Infinity products in terms of sound. Everyone knows that. But where this scores extremely highly over all its competitors is in terms of battery back up. One full charge happens in about an hour. And the battery stays for at least 2 weeks, of you use it on an average of 3 to 4 hours a day. I'm not kidding, trust me. It's really that good!\n\n", "\n\n  The sound and bass is superb. It's normal mode have bass which is more than enough. I don't find any need of deep bass mode.The battery backup is good and last for 3-4 days at moderate use.It's really comfortable to use. Not pressure on ears.Some problems that i face -There is lag in audio while playing pubg and watching TV on Tata sky.Not for gaming purpose.Otherwise watch video on YouTube or online streaming apps there is no lag.Just go for it if you are not going to use it for gaming.People who say it does not have bass, it really depends on your phone output. I use OnePlus 6\n\n", '\n\n  Build quality is poor, and feels cheap plastic. The comfort is not there at all, after 2 hours or so your ears will start to pain. There are no padding where it touches the head, and it pains there as well. This is very important with people who are bald or tonsured. The sound quality is ok, not so great. But for the price there are other better options.On the positive side the battery life and Bluetooth connectivity are good.\n\n', "\n\n  First of all i want to say that amazon packing is worst.....my product at first delivered has a broken seal and i ordered for replacementNow when it comes to product....unlike in many reviews they said that there is pain in ears....i couldn't see any pain there....it was best head phones with true bass and good sound quality.At last one thing..jbl is producing great products at this segment too\n\n", "\n\n  The reason for the heading is because of the connectivity issues I do face while connecting I with the Laptop. It pops out some kind of sound during MS Teams calls and makes hearing difficult. Or else on You tube you may run it for a longer duration or with mobile. No such issues are found.As I said it's a good product with Harman brand..\n\n", "\n\n  I liked many things in this headphones like the clear sound quality, bass quality and voice assistant feature. This wireless headphones are very trendy & stylish and easily connects with the bluetooth your cell phone and laptop.Few improvements I would suggest that the headphone listening ear pads can be a few radius of circumference bigger because I found the circumference of the earpads are little tight for my ears after listening for 1or 2hr long. You would feel like It doesn't properly fit to your ear probably there will be no problem with kids but you can always use few elongation inches on both sides of your headphone and set it as you like the fit to your ear. I do so. Otherwise the product is absolutely amazing no doubt. Go for it.\n\n", '\n\n  Great value for money . My primary / sole use is for Webex / Zoom calls+ Ve’s- Battery life- sound clarity- decent  noise cancellation-Ve’s- plastic quality of headband not so great . They could add a thousand odd bucks and make it plush- Can pair only to one device at a time ( so if you wanna use it with two , that could be a challenge )Other than the above 2 , overall great value for money and would recommend it if your primary use is voice ( never used it for music ) so for music it is unrated from my side\n\n', "\n\n  1. Sound quality: Sound is good, not the best. Bass is nice. Given the price of the headphones, it is quite satisfactory.2. Noise cancellation: Although these headphones don't have active noise cancellation, the cushion sits quite comfortably and the outside noise gets blocked. At about 80% volume, I cannot hear most of the sounds from outside (even if someone right in front of me is speaking).Also, there is very low sound leakage when you're wearing it.3. Battery: In the first charging it gave close to 20hrs (as advertised on the pack). From the next charging cycle onward, it lasts about 12-15 hrs (from 100% to 10% battery). It takes about 45mins-55 mins to charge fully (no type C fast charging).4. Build and comfort: Many reviews say the plastic is cheap. I disagree. The frame is light, but sturdy. It is adjustable, so if you feel it to be too tight, you can adjust. Some reviews mentioned pain in the ear. I didn't face any discomfort. The cushion is soft, and there has been no peeling even after 1 month of continuous usage.5. Durability: Like I have mentioned before, I have been using this for a month. I will update and give 5 stars if this lasts close to a year.In summary, I am quite happy with the product. The performance and build is well worth the money.\n\n", '\n\n  I am writing this review after almost 4 months of use of this product. Thus, every word written here is self experienced and not a review given in hurry within days of use.It certainly grabs more sound from the surrounding than my own voice. Not a good product to use in calls. Also continuous long term use may give a pain to your pinna. Sometimes connectivity issues occur... not very often but often. Battery is good as of now, it works for a long time of 20 hrs approax. Sound sometimes cutoff.. it started just recently 1 month back. other than that design, bass, noise cancellation is good.\n\n', '\n\n  Amazing audio quality.. two issuesNo mute button on the headset, would have been very helpful for those attending Conf callsThe microphone stops working when switching on and pairing, once in awhile, may be a software issue that might get fixed...\n\n', "\n\n  The build quality is cheap, it's not from JBL, deep bass mode is noisy, theere is a ringing sound in the right ear piece when someone is talking or when listening to music which is very annoying. I wouldn't suggest this buy.\n\n", "\n\n  If you are looking for a awesome sounding pair of wireless headsets, look no further. Locks horns with the leaders with ease ( believe me I am one of those wierdos who looks for silly reasons to buy headphones- BOSE to Senheiser, have it all) . The infinity probably does not beat them but comes a close second.The only problem is it's build quality. Probably not for a user who wants to over abuse it. Can't expect a Volvo for the price of a Nano as far as build goes.\n\n", "\n\n  Headphones are worth the price if you want to simply use it. I would give the sound system 3 1/2 stars but that doesn't mean the sound quality is bad. Infact the sound is just fine if you're looking for cheap headphones. Bluetooth connectivity is fine & sometimes you might wanna switch on your phones Bluetooth first & then connect with the headphones if they're not pairing immediately. Battery life is great but I just wish they had given a charger adapter along with it & not just a charging cable. Also another minus side is the chargine cable being really small something just 1/2 the size of your arm. Otherwise everything else is alright. Not too good & not that bad.\n\n", "\n\n  I'm sharing my personal experience after 1 month of usage. My primary usage is whf web calls. Can't able to wear more than one hour, creating pain in the ear.Multiple times it stops working in middle of the meetings. You need to switch it off and on again.For calls I can give 3 stars out of 5Watching movies with this headphone is completely waste, it will filter out the bass from the movie and it will play only vocals. No difference between the 2 eq settings. Most of the sound effects are being filtered out from the movie. I can't provide even 1 star for watching movies, it's completely a scrap.\n\n", "\n\n  Hi,I just bought this new headphone JBL Infinity 510 and I am just impressed by its performance and quality. Well, I will talk about both pros and cons.Pros:1) Its dual Bass mode actually works. Its deep bass mode has the bass that shook your whole body. And its normal bass which I use and liked more than other one because it makes the sound crystal clear.2) Its battery life just amazed me but here's an issue. It doesn't give you a 72 hrs battery backup . Its close to 40-50 hrs but its quite more than its other version JBL Infinity 500.3) It charges to quick.4) It comes in a good budget and gives you a great sound quality which is worthy at this price.5) It pairs too quick.6) Its ear cushion are soft which is a good thing if you wear it for hours.Cons:1) It doesn't support fast charging. Its only support a 5V adapter to charge.2) The charging cable which comes with it is just a silly thing that JBL gives in this set. Its too short and thin.At last of all that I would say if you want a headphone in budget, go for it. Its a great deal.\n\n", '\n\n  This review is after one year of continuous usage. The sound quality is very good, especially the bass quality. It has two modes, one is normal mode and another deep bass mode. It is very light weight and easily foldable, will not break in normal usage. It can be folded and kept in back pocket, it is that convinent. After listening to more than two hours your ears will hurt, especially if you are using spectacles. Mic pic up is great quality. There is no active noise cancellation.After around one nd half years the cushion pad leather will start peeling. But its alright, peel everything nd nd u are good to go.\n\n', "\n\n  It has a big battery life.. but it's only good for listening to music.Latency is way too high for watching videos or movies. Gaming is impossible with so much delay.And they say it's from JBL, which is unbelievable considering the unusability of this device due to extremely high latency of around one second, even may be more.Raised a return.\n\n", "\n\n  One of the worst product by such name. The headphone would switch off automatically and diconnect with the device you're connected with. I'm using it on my MI device connected with my LED TV and it works fine when fully charged until it reaches below 70% battery level it'll turn off automatically.Imagine watching a movie and it turn off automatically and the TV sound scares off your surrounding people... Don't buy it.. useless product by such a good brand.\n\n", "\n\n  Sound quality/clarity is about 80% of my previous Creative on-the-ear headset but at half the price which is justified. While the ear cups are soft, I don't find these on-the-ear cups as comfortable as simple flat pads: wonder why that wouldn't be the standard. Rest of the features, deep bass, looks, foldability and volume level are just about fine. Overall, can't question the value for money. So, keeping the price point in mind, giving it a rating of 4.0\n\n", '\n\n  Pros :The headphones have really good battery back up ( nearly 7 days usage of 6-8 hours on single charge ) .Bluetooth connectivity works fine upto 2-3 rooms .Passive noise cancellation works fine .Deep base mode provides super baseCons :Headphones aren’t much loud .Although cushions are superfine but still i feel them uncomfortable for using for long hours ( like 6 hours or so ) and had to switch backs to wires .I think mic could have been better at this price range .*some complaints about it not having aux but that’s fine as it has like really good battery backup.\n\n', '\n\n  Amazon is amazing in the matter of delivery.This is my first impression review. I will edit it after few days.Built quality is good.Sound is amazingly crystal clear.Bass is ok.Earcups are soft.Small amount of earache after half hour use but I think it will gradually decrease.Battery is amazing.No option for warranty registration at Harman site.I will certainly recommend these over boat rockerz 400 because I was using them previously.

If I were to rate it on a scale of 5, on the basis of various factors thenSound quality - 4.3Battery life - 4.6Bass quality - 4.2Material quality - 4.0Noise cancellation 4.0Comfort level - 3.8I would say that the bass is much emphasized on this one and sometimes it may feel a bit harsh, but at appropriate sound level and adjusting the equalizer according to your preference the vocals were clear and the overall sound signature was impressive.Talking about the comfort level then, honestly after using them continuously for around  45 min didn't cause any issue but later they seemed a bit uncomfortable and I had to put them aside , but still that's not a deal breaker.The battery life was the best in this category. It has been a week now that I am using them and I can say that they lasted roughly for around 15 to 16 hours  when used from a 90% charge as they had arrived.Also they were completely charged in around 1 hr 20 min.To sum up I would say that these are a pretty descent on- ear wireless headphones at this price and you can definitely give it a try.\n\n", '\n\n  my old philips shb4405 felt irritating but compared to these they feel like a feather. please make sure that you are right for headphones as heavy as these. also they are quite tight and the shape of ear muffs is not according to ear size and is difficult to wear as it continuously pushes against your head and a headache begins soon after\n\n', '\n\n  Not worth it. very low sound n very bad quality of sound.dont waist ur money by 72 hours bettery back up.bettery back is allso not more then 6 hours and bluetooth connection is allso very poor not more then 5 to 7 meters.\n\n', "\n\n  So, I have been using this headphone for last 7 days.I have some pros and cons to mention about this headphone.Pros:Firstly, I have to mention that it has a good sound quality. Music on dual base mode is seriously good as per this price range. 👍Secondly, the battery life is enough to satisfy any customer of this product. If you are a light or medium user of headphone, you can use it for 7 days approximately. I have used on an average of 4 to 5 hours daily and it was last for 7 days.👍Thirdly, bluetooth connectivity is perfect. It connects with my mobile very easily and it also provides a perfect connection while you're on a call. You will not face any lag while calling .👍Fourthly, I have played PUBG and didn't find any latency issue, worked properly for me but if you are a hard-core gamer then it is not for you.Cons:This is not very much comfortable on the ear. After using of 1.5 hour I need to adjust the headphone or need to remove it from my ear. But it is okay for this price range.👎I think if they provide a 40mm driver then it will perform much more better than the current 36mm driver. Basically I was expecting for 40mm driver 👎 Still I love the music quality .🤓You can't use any aux in this model, this is a major disadvantage.-------------------------------In short if you want a good music quality and you are a light or medium user of headphone, This might be the perfect one for this price range. And I can suggest that it will be a good partner while you travel.✌️\n\n", "\n\n  Writing this review after 4 months of usage.Sound quality: nice. Good for watching movies, YouTube and casual music. If you want well defined lows and highs with proper instrument separation look at oppo enco m31. Use bass mode only is you want some earpain. In normal mode this is 100% better than any boat headphones in this segment.Battery life: Outstanding! I use it for 1-2 hours per day and I charge it once a month for 2 hours. Tension free if you're a frequent traveler.Comfort: Decent. A bit tight when it's new but sits comfortably a while later. Cushioning could have been better though.Bluetooth connectivity is ok and on par with the segmentCons: no headphone jack but you won't need it trust me.Hardly any noise cancellation at mid volumes.At high volumes the sound leaks outside aand others can hear it. But this problem exists in all on the ear headphones.Overall a value for money headphone and if your budget is <2k go for it!\n\n", "\n\n  It keeps losing bluetooth connection during zoom/teams call on top of having a very bad call quality. Haven't reviewed with google meet. Have to switch back to a wired device which makes it lose the purpose of buying a wireless device.Its only good for streaming/youtube etc. With significant bass it vibrates on the ear when volumed up.

Here the case isn't different. The sound quality is great.Talking about the 72 hr battery backup, it's NOT that long. I got a maximum of 64 hrs. But then again i didn't used them on normal mode at all. I used deep bass mode.Talking about this mode, it's actually great.

Only after I created a scene with Amazon CS, I got my original Infinity Glide 510 as a replacement order. Replacement had different packaging (it was tamper proof) & button quality and logo were different to feel and touch and it instantly connected to my laptop after I paired.

So, please choose wisely.If i talk about the sound quality. It sounds good in bass boosted mode but if you want to listen to soft music then it doesn't sound that good.

It is so strong that your ears will start paining after 20 mins of usage. I initially thought it will get adjusted after a month or so, but even after 45 days I don't find any relief.2) Sometimes it get automatically disconnected while you're the call in mobile phone. Not sure the pattern and you need to manually reconnect for you to continue with the call.General observationYou can buy the product at this cost, but as my neighbour asked did we get geninune Infinity product for this price is big question mark as I don't find the sound quality of that amazing 😉.\n\n", "\n\n  An amazing product at this price. Excellent sound quality and the bass is really good in the deep-bass mode.

Connection stability: Bluetooth once connected doesn't disconnect even in very long usage in calling or media streaming.4.Looks stylish: The matt finish looks awesome.5.**Sound**: The bass and the treble are perfectly balanced. Bass is very pleasent. Even there is deep bass mode but it kill the quality for the sake of bass so I found it not very useful.CONS :1. Volume : Not very loud as some people prefer otherwise it's good.2. Sound: People looking for that extra thump bass effect may not find it good.3. Annoying sound :  I sometime hear a *ting* sound in my right side headphone while talking on call and then the sound suddenly disappears.4. No Aux cable. Gamers and music lovers may find it a bit upsetting because a cabled headphone reduces gaming latency and enhance music quality.5. On ear Headphones : People who like over the head head phone may find it a little small but the cushioning is very good.I hope you people find this review helpful.Go for this product if you find my review helpful.\n\n", '\n\n  Updated review after 3 months of usagePurchased for my kid for online classes... it was just perfect on our requirementsBut In just 3 months left side of headphone has stopped workingUnderstanding one year warranty tried to connect customer care but no luck, have raised request from official site but no response and also to mention: could not find this product for registration on infinity official website... not sure what to do next ..Old reviewDecent sound quality, Microphone works with great clarity, comfortable cushions and best part is battery after using for a month can say that it lasted at least for 50 hours with single charge...Awesome!!!Can not demand more for this price.Just go for it if planning to to buy.\n\n', '\n\n  Awesome product .The most important feature I like about this product is its battery backup . I used it for 5 days continuously (4-5 hrs) per day and the battery level was not below 50 %. Good noise cancellation and boosted beat feature adds its uniqueness ! Sound quality is cool. But the ear cup cushion gets a bit warm after putting on the head phone for more than 2 hrs..... Bluetooth connectivity is awesome !And the weird part is that ,this headphone came in its box ,but its parcel box was of the size that it looked like it contained a pressure cooker 😄 ! I was really confused whether it was my package or not !Using it for more that 1 and a half month .... Working everything fine.... Go for it ....\n\n', "\n\n  Quality of the headphone is really good, very light weight and flexible. Sound quality is amazing specially the bass but noise cancellation isn't good enough and I am only disappointed with the battery life as its mentioned 20hrs but i am hardly getting 15 -16hrs. And since there is no AUX port we can't use it with wire. Overall its good\n\n", "\n\n  Sound quality is good for songs. Microphone not upto the mark... When you are using for online meeting it is not recommended because of Microphone quality.I don't find product details for warranty registration in the Harman website.

My ears are small amd these headphones hurt my ears after few hours..\n\n", "\n\n  Battery backup lives to it's standard. Once charged up lasts more than 10 days songs, calls etc. Best economical brand from an American company though product made in China. Only drawback earcups small in size compared to other brands.

I had to replace these headphones because they were faulty. The replaced one have stopped working after a month now. It keeps getting disconnected from devices even though there is 100% charge.

I've been sold a faulty product for the second time now.\n\n", '\n\n  Its not too bulky and stiff and being light weight makes it a handy product. Being from JBL ensures a decent build and sound quality. I have been using this for over a month and have forgot to bother about battery charge. Though I usually use it for about 3-4 hrs per day and may be thats the reason the charge last for almost a week. Since I am not a hardcore users, but i use it for attending calls after working hours as its wireless of which sound clarity is decent enough.

What makes it stand out as a deal is the price of 1499, for which I bought.\n\n', "\n\n  The right side of the headphones stops working within a month. Even with minimal usage and no robust use, the sound doesn't come from the right side. When tilting your head it sets right. There is manufacturing problem in the headphones.

Awesome like really awesome battery backup2. Charge really fasts and last really long3. Build quality is great i've dropped it many times still intact.4. Great sound quality best for slow soothing songs.Cons:1. The speakers since they can rotate they kinda get loose after some time but it's not a big issue.2. The BASS is quite less u can get better bass for cheaper price. So if u r party music lover with high bass then it's just ok for u . Not so good.3. The buttons are too hard u can hear the click sound when u press themOverall gr8 product for this price from a good company . And if like slow soothint song with average bass u would love them\n\n", "\n\n  Nice product and I've been using it for 2 months. Awesome sound quality I already recommended to my friends.

Which lasted about 3 days on normal days.Cons:1. The head adjustments make it uncomfortable for using long hours.2. Bass quality is okay.3. Wireless range is low.If you want to use it for as an alternative to your wired headphones or using it for professional work than it would be great for you.\n\n', "\n\n  I have been using this for around a year now....The sound quality is good. Bass is decent. If you take a call with headphones, mic is not great so they can't hear what you're saying properlyIf you are in a zoom or teams meeting and try playing music on Spotify or something in the background, the music quality gets reduced and sounds like crap. The fit is not great because you can't tilt the cups towards or away- it is an awkward fit and might hurt after long use. Battery life is decent and seems to hold charge for long. Good budget buy overall for a bt headphone, not very great but does the job well.But because there are no wires, it makes it so easy and suitable to work. Bluetooth range of the device is good - I can listen to music from bottom floor when my phone is on top floor so that's coolGo for it if you want reliable, good quality headphones👍\n\n", "\n\n  I have used jbl brands before and the product quality that I received was very bad .. the above features is not true ..The volume didn't even go a bit higher than my phone's volume at highest .. no strictly no ..

But some noises come from outside but it is ignorable.It has a adjustable band so no problem of adjusting with head.It also has Voice Assistant.(Google Assistant, Siri, Cortana but I do not think it has Alexa)Awesome battery life and qualityCons:No 3.5 mm jack so if battery runs out you cannot connect it with wire.No cushioning on the headband_______________________________________________________________________________________________________I mainly bought it for my child's online classes so it is good enough for that and I think it is also good for listening music as it does not have any disturbances and for gaming I would suggest wired earphones and if wireless then of high quality like JBL and etc.\n\n", "\n\n  Excellent BT headset with amazing bass.

The battery lasts over 16 hours and that is what you need, there are no other headphones in the market that lasts this long in a single charge, and this cheap.I am planning to get the new model they have released in next 5 months since it claims 40hrs life and i would be humble if it gives me 30 hours.This is made for the Indian market and with Indians in mind, no need to check the battery level every time you pick these, you can definitely assure to have at least 8  hours of playback time and also it charges too fast, which is an added advantage at this price point.\n\n', '\n\n  Outstanding battery life!!. Very good for WFH uses. Provides reasonable isolation. Can use it in rooms. Better to turn off the extra bass feature which is ON by default. This makes it good for calls and music also.

If you are planning to buy this for anything else, it's rubbish.There is no return policy on thisusage 2 weeksSound Quality - 1/5 (the deep base mode just goes boom boom and ruins the entire song. hence deeps base is not usable). The normal base is also dry and does not feel rich.Battery life - 5/5 it never gets over and will easily last the entire day. BUT you need a normal charger, fast charger not supported.comfort - this is a negative 5 on 5. (0/5) it is pathetic ears will pain in 10 mins, cushions very bad and hard, also there is a major problem -if you tap on the side of the headphones on the plastic part, the sound vibrations are so strong it becomes unbearable !!

Now also I'm getting some problems while being on call that it disconnects a lot.You can go for it because they are atleast way better than other brands but the only prblm is the connectivity. Maybe I've got some defective product.\n\n", "\n\n  Awesome product with minimal cost. No need to use deep bass, normal bass itself has perfect bass and sound quality. I am a Sennheiser 275s earphone user for long time and it always gives good quality of sound but after using this headphone I have felt that a headphone gives more quality tune and it is pretty obvious because they have bigger driver size.For nomal talk microphone works pretty well. But for low sound talk this product will not fulfill your target.The most promising ability of it is battery backup. When I got the headphone it shows 80% battery. After usage of 2 days for nearly 15 hours of music and video lecture it shows 70% battery and that is very satisfying for a customer. 72 hours battery backup claimed by the company is worth. It will easily give you more than 10 days backup in single charge with decent usage. Don't worry about it.Build quality is decent and justified with the price. I have no comfort issue till now.Charge it with the computer usb port & it will not take longer time as in case of mobile 👍.Product priceIn Harmanaudio - 1799In Amazon - 16991000 less in amazon but product is genuine don't worry about it.Must go for it, it doesn't disappoint you.\n\n", '\n\n  Sound is too low. The coverage on ears is too small, suitable for kids. The headphone worked fine for a week and then started giving problems. It kept continuously disconnecting even after pairing freshly and connecting. The only good thing is the battery life. I will not recommend this to anyone.\n\n', '\n\n  I am using this from two days and i can say battery backup is amazing as they claim.So no need to talk about battery.Sound- As compared to boat rockerz 400  which i have used for 3 years, boat  wins. Its a bit low sound.Bass- Amazing bass its like when i turn on  bass mode my ear lobe vibrates 😂.Fitting- Damm...i have been looking for a  headphone for gym, which doesnt come out from ear and its the perfect fit u can run while wearing them but u cant wear countinously they are tight. Your ears will hurtLook-  is cheap but made of strong material.\n\n', "\n\n  Sound quality is good. If you use an equilizer then you can get good audio profile according to your preference. Noise cancellation is average as it's an over the ear headphone so don't expect too much. Bass quality is good in deep bass mode and again it comes on the customer preference how much they need. Bass can be twiked by equilizer. Battery capacity is nice. If you are taking too much of calls then it will discharge a bit faster but medium amount of calls and music will give you approximately 1 day of battery backup easily. Headphone is quite light and portable. You can fold it in any manner you like. You will get used to of it within 2-3 days. Speaking about build quality, its made of plastic which is quite strong but extreme rough use may cause some malfunction. So handle with little bit of care and you are good to go. And it's looks are also quite decent. It's not very attractive but it doesn't looks bad either. Bluetooth connectivity is fast and it's version is 5.0 so you get good range. Only flaw is that it's not made for gaming. You cannot simply play pubg wearing this headphone because there's a half a second delay. And in pubg half a second is also very very important. It's not at all gaming headphone. Apart from gaming you can use it everywhere. Even it's microphone is quite awesome. Receiver end doesn't suffer to hear your voice. It's quality is good.\n\n", '\n\n  I had this product exchange as there is a constant metallic sound on Right Ear when youbuse it for Calls. If youbare listening to instrumental music you can feel the "Tang Tang" Sound constantly.Performance wise its best for listening music and battery life.They should remove the fault of metallic sound.\n\n', '\n\n  Infinity (JBL) Glide 500 Wireless On-Ear Dual EQ Deep Bass Headphones with 20 Hours Playtime & Mic is best branded wireless headphone in budget range in India.

Totally worth the price I guess..don't expect much.\n\n", '\n\n  The product ia good for the price but has a lot of issues. Even with the latest bluetooth, there is frequent connection issues even at ckose range while moving/ running which is extremely irritating. The fit is okay for a shitt time but starts to hurt the ear if out in for long durations. The sweat on it too accumilates while wearing it for over say, half na hour. The build feels cheap but is turdy enough, though I guess it is expected for this price range. The max volume is also a bit low and noise cancellation is minimal, which coild have been better.\n\n', "\n\n  Overall this is a really nice product.. i decided on this going by the reputation of Infinity brand.Sound quality is pretty decent. Bass is punchy but lacks depth. Mids and highs are just fine..Well suited to all kinds of music but If you are particularly into soft and soothing kind of music, u cannot get anything better than this in this price bracket.Cushions are decent and passive noise cancelling is adequate in my view.Battery backup is very goodOnly negative abt this device is plasticky feel which doesn't goes well with the brand reputation of Infinity. Another negative point is delay in audio during gameplay and video playback..But when u look at the price which u are paying for this, this is a decent package and can b relied on\n\n", '\n\n  The product is as what it says. Excellent sound. Bass is good. Long range as it says in description. I even tried it with about 25 ft with two walls between and it works.

After the first re-charge, it now refuses to stay connected to any device beyond 3 minutes. The entire process of re-pairing which requires both the devices to re start is needed every time.While the sound quality too was not up to other harman products and the quality of noise cancellation is also very average, the non functioning of the device within 2 months is a shocker.Spend more money and buy JBL is what my advise would be. If you want to stick to this budget, go for another brand. Even a Boat is better.\n\n', "\n\n  Heyyyy amazon it's my first headset were I have bought it from amazon and it's really really really amazing and the packing and the box were really done well and I loved the product, it's crazy and booming out, Its fabulous and really amazing, but guys don't worry it may hurt ur outer ear for 2-3 days of use coz it should be properly set for your ears, so it happens In all the headset, so it's worth buying and really you guys must buy this infinity jbl glide 500 and body design and structure is classic in black color and battery backup is crazy and it's good deal from Harman...

I i am saying right ,it has 50% battery after using it almost 2 month.If you are taking this for gaming ,please don't go for this,there is 3-4 seconds sound delay as usual in every bluetooth headfone.But the main point is that the headphone doesn't had a aux cable jack,which promotes a big issue in gaming.If you are looking for fitness then also i will say that don't buy this,because daily runners and daily gym workouting guys wear the headfone for 20-30 minute and beleive me my head is small but then also ache starts in my ears if i wear this for only 5 minutes.But there is some good points that it has strong bass and also low bass ,it has features to low down the bass and to grab the bass high.After looking at all of the points i will say that don't buy this.Thank you for reading.\n\n", "\n\n  Okay so here is an honest review about my infinity glide 510. I bought this one on July and have completed 5 months using it. It's a great product for this price range. Sound quality is awesome, if you're a basshead you should go for it, There are 2 modes for bass i.e 1) Normal bass  2) Deep bassbut I prefer to use it in normal bass mode as it does it's job pretty well. Vocals are also very clear and crispy on this headphone. Even I was a bit unsure before buying this one but now I am happy of this purchase. For first few days or a week you'll feel this a bit tight over your ears but gradually the headphones adjust after sometime.

I only have to charge it once in a week(sometimes the battery lasts more than a week).Calling experience so far is clear. I mean the mic is clear and the noise cancelation is top notch. Only sometimes, when on call, I hear a ting, like when you press the buttons, the spring inside makes a tiny ting noise but apart from that its great.It's lightweight and the earpads are soft so my ears don't pain even after I wear it for hours.All in all a great headphones.\n\n", '\n\n  Dont buy this headphone total waste of money , left side stopped working in just 2 months the coustomer care says to go to service centre but its not available everywhere you might have to travel a lot and traveling in this pandemic is very dangerous ,go for earphoned you will get awesome earphone in range from 1k to 2k\n\n', "\n\n  A good headphone for Music lovers who want a cheap wireless headphone.Sometimes connectivity fluctuations but thats just for 0.5 seconds if I say.Not made for gaming as it will lag so don't even think of gaming (I tried it on Call of Duty).I use it on full volume and people around me can hear what I am listening that's how bassy and loud it is\n\n", '\n\n  1.

After visiting the service centre provided by Harman, they said that my warranty had expired and it cannot be repaired. They even refused paid repairs of the product.

On a negative side, its a little painful for your ears if you use them on a continuous stretch of more than 2 hours. Also for a longer call it gets disconnected in between, its really frustrating. I have been using them for more than 6 months and there has been no big issue so far. But for 1.5k its the best deal you can get.

I have to talk very loud so the other party could hear properly which becomes irritating as I thought of using it for my office calls.If you hear music on a little high volume, then people sitting in the room can also hear it. It kindoff defeats the purpose of using headphones.Definitely not for gaming( even performs poorly in fnatic mode in Oneplus).Overall, if you are an average user who doesn't do gaming and wont use the headphones for calls, might think of buying it.

Unbelievable! I used the headphones every alternate day for an hour and they lasted 3 weeks on a single charge and were still about 25% charged. Noise cancellation is reasonable (about 80%) and again, for this price, good enough. Bass is ok but nothing more can be expected. Build quality is slightly wanting but it’s light and strong enough. Also, very importantly, although in the Q&A they say it connects to BT 4.0 etc, it actually doesn’t and is only compatible with BT 5.0. So that’s one thing to keep in mind.

This happens everytime even if you pause things for 15 to 30 seconds.Maybe this is feature for battery saving, as it does have great battery backup.

The battery backup also goes for all day long ~12hrs on normal use. And it gets charged quickly, in my experience in less than 2hrs. Also the connectivity is nice.

There is no issue with Bluetooth range as it was able to penetrate multiple walls as well. However, another reason to return the product was it's stiffness and pressure it creates on the ear. It's not possible to use contentiously for even 30 minutes. JBL should  look after the mic issue and please make it little light and flexible so that pressure on ear get reduce.\n\n", '\n\n  Headphones are really good. Good palyback and noise cancellation.

Okay, so here's my review.1. Sound not very loud but excellent for me and works perfectly. Sound is satisfactory as it should be for human ears unless you love bleeding your ears.2. Battery life I would give 110/100 <3 I hardly charge 20minutes and its plenty enough for 2 days. And believe me, I'm a heavy user. I use them for almost the whole day.  BEST BATTERY EVER SEEN IN THIS RANGE OF HEADPHONE. I LL GIVE IT THAT. Never had a rough time cause of low charging.3. Now talking about the microphone and sound cancellation, Well it depends, if you are in a silent atmosphere, the voice will be crisp clear compared to noisy. Cancellation would be around 50% I guess, pretty impressive though.4. BLUETOOTH:  BEST CONNECTIVITY AND WORKS better IF CONNECTED ON A LAPTOP OR COMPUTER.5. COMFORT: I wear than hours and hours, very comfortable, Ear pain is out of the question. Feel a little itchy after some hours though it's natural, maybe the sweat and skin reacts. Anyway overall it's good. If they would have provided cushion overhead it would be a plus one but dah, They have provided plenty in the price.6. DESIGN: Perfect, don't worry it looks good and stylish. I got a blue one. It's sexy.CONS:Nah not for me, I think I got my hands on perfect headphones for me in the price.Sometimes, a very few times have happened when I switch Bluetooth connection from laptop to mobile, it doesn't connect then I have to forget the device and pair it again, but that's that! Nothing major.ANYWAY, RECOMMENDED PRODUCT, IF YOU HAVE A BUDGET OF 1500-2000 FOR A HEADPHONE, STOP SEARCHING AND BUY IT RIGHT AWAY, WORTH THE PRICE ADN SUPERIOR QUALITY. AS EXPECTED BY HARMAN. <3CONS SO FAR:Nothing\n\n", "\n\n  ProsLonger battery: Once charged I hadn't charged it till now. so for minimal users, the battery will last for one and a half to two months.Best noise cancellation: The external noise is getting cancelled using this headphone.ConsBluetooth connectivity: Bluetooth connectivity using phones performs well, but it is irritating to use this headphones in my laptop as it frequently disconnects itself\n\n", '\n\n  Well u can go for it..... very very very light weight.... quite happy with the product..... some of u might be say that the packaging is not good.... yes i do agree.... with u...... amazon or seller needs to wrap this product in bubble wrap..... but no worries... as per the price u can go for sound is good bass is good bass can be improved....Thanks!!!\n\n', '\n\n  Waste of money.

Hope that my revied will help many..\n\n', '\n\n  Hi,If you are planning to use this Headphone to talk thru phone/laptop, please avoid it, since Mic is not picking the audio and the people on other end will find it difficult to hear us.Also Bass quality is average only.Better avoid this product.C.S.N\n\n', "\n\n  I was very confused with this and JBL 460BT . Suddenly i thought why shouldn't i give it a try as this came from the same Harman family. And finally you know this is amazing!  Bass is just perfect and punchy! Even small cracks in music stands out clear! Don't even worry this one don't have noise cancellation you're not going to hear anything out of this  headphones while hearing in decent volume. Don't hesitate guys it's gonna worth for 1500 without a doubt.\n\n", '\n\n  Unboxing - It has come in a plastic see through box with a manual guide and a USB charging cable.Build quality -It is made of good quality plastic, and ear pads are good enough to give you comfort feeling.

Battery will last long even after recharging for half an hour or tho. What I don't like is that the device hurts my ears (may be a personal issue) because of its light buds(using continuously for 2.5hrs). The worst part about it is the connectivity issue it has , sometimes it just disconnects and sometimes it doesn't. It's like it has a mind of its own. But the device is all together a good budget friendly headphone.\n\n", "\n\n  It echoes sometimes.

From a personal experience, this does not work when using it for online meetings (Google Meet, Teams, etc); the sounds breaks or cuts off and no one can hear you speak.

If you are a base lover than this is the best option under 2k. But i tell you what that the noise cancellation is not too much impressive or much bad. Bluetooth Connectivity is fine. Let me tell you if you take volume more than 60 than it hace a playtime of 30-40hrs. And in volume less than 40 had a playtime more than 40hrs. But it does not have an cable or ox. In other word it has only wireless connection.Thank you\n\n', "\n\n  Super sound n soothing base...as always JBL products have zero quality issues and always satisfied using it.

The mike quality is good and can make calls from slack, teams, skype using the headset. The problem is sometimes it disconnects and re-connects back after sometime while you are in a call.
