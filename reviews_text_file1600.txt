It directly related to Mobile display and colour quality, Higher is better.3) Check Mobile camera F value (lower value, higher picture quality) if less than 1.8 is best.

The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn’t give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you’re choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you’ll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review\n\n', "\n\n  This is Samsung's worst phone and it hs many glitches. Samsung doesn't even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone.

Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices.

I probably had conversation for almost 10-15 mins but he was always coming to point he is not seeing problem. This was my first experience with samsung phone and this will be the last.

No Slowmotion, Timelapse & other basic features in camera.▪︎It doesn't support Camera2Api which means I cannot download GCam.▪︎Worst Screen resolution. While everyone is giving Super Amoled display & Full HD display, what happened to you Samsung??▪︎90Hz refresh rate is just gimmick.▪︎8nm processor is also waste.▪︎While all others are giving Snapdragon processors, Samsung is stuck with its Exynos which is basically useless.

If you are buying this phone for a standby purpose, then it is fine and worth the money. If you are considering to buy this as a primary phone, take deep breaths and look further for better options in the same budget segment.Always check the manufacturer website for specification details before buying the product.\n\n", '\n\n  Had some expectations. Worst mobile experience. I might be happy if I have bought this phone 4 years back. Such a bad touch screen slogging performance. Nothing is good in this\n\n', '\n\n  Very bad product.I never think such a product will come from Samsung.It had 48 MP only for show.Photos are not clear .On checking the photo size I found that 12mp again I was astonished I contacted customer care of Samsung they told me to change the camera setting 48 MP then I got photo in 48mp the clear not better than previous one .It gives very low quality photo again.It was my experience.I had bought by dreaming photo clarity.Net work problem is usually Samsung problem here .The only better thing in this phone is battery and quick charging\n\n', '\n\n  After a long span of time say 3 years, im back to Samsung. Now, Samsung realise that selling their name is no more working and reduce the price at the level of other company to success in the market . I bought 6 gb one and very happy with it now.However,  as before, many of the inbuild apps irritating me which are not uninstallable.After using it for 3 months plus, let me give my fair opinion:1. Battery life makes me happy, but fast charging needs 2 hrs plus is little bit annoying.2. Camera must not be more than 12 Megapixel. As compared to my previous phone MI Note 6 pro, I dont see any better snap here.3. Finger print sensor is absolutely annoying. Most time i have to enter my password manually as FP sensor do not detect my fingerprint. How my previous phone MI Note 6 pro nicely detects my fingerprint and easily open phone has been missing here.4. As MAH is more, thr weight of phone is bit heavy. I dont know why Silicon cover of around Rs 99 approx cannot be attached here in the package!! I bought silicon cover from Amazon but lately arrived which cause my phone screeen crack due to fallen from my bed. If it was in Silicon cover, the Lcd must have been intact till now. MI 6 Pro had come with one extra phone safety cover but Samsung cannot.5. After two years , I come to Samsung again hoping much UI improvement. However, i found Samsung do not compete with even MI in certain ways. I need to put Alarm clock on, i can easily go directly to all clock setting by clicking wall paper clock in MI while this phone need me to go to the clock in menu and so. When a turn on torch, i can easily turn it off by pressing power button in MI while this phone needs me to open screen and tap on torch icon in menu manuallyAs off now, i can point out these points to ascertain my judgement. I will comeback after using a year if get time\n\n', "\n\n  Edit1: adding on after using it for a few months, the call quality is terrible and microphone is also not working properly, Please look after other ones, waste of moneyThough the battery life is great, the charge time is long. Don't buy it. The performance  drop is so exaggerated. We can't switch between  apps without waiting for 3 to 4 seconds minimum.  Camera quality is bad as well.Edit 2:Worst mobile I have ever bought. Never buy it. There are lots of bugs, wifi calling gets switched off automatically, Sim signal service are irritating. Bluetooth is of inferior quality.

No issues on the screen, though  it is not amoled for an average user it is not a big difference.For the price this is a great buy, of course there is no snapdragon chip. But the exynos 850 is 8nm and at this price point is comparable to most snapdragon 6series chipsets.Camera is decent. As long as you are not a professional photographer,  this will be good enough to take atleast average if not great pics. (Some  pics are really great).This is definitely not an iPhone or one plus.

Storage is plenty with Expandability. Form factor I found good Too.Cons: Performance; sometimes it lags and the 90hzs is a gimmick, the UI itself is too laggy to notice it's smoothness. They went wrong in cameras too, just because they can afford to put a 48 megapixel camera doesn't mean it's good. The ISP is bad and makes even the bayered photos look noisy. I would suggest to use a GCam mod, then again I didn't find one that works perfectly for Exynos 850. Also other 3 cameras are just as bad if not worse. Shooting raw helps if you have the time to edit it later on Lightroom or snapseed.Also Noticed that the software adds background blur that looks unnatural, at f2.0 this should not happen at all.Get it for you parents.\n\n", '\n\n  Actually i brought this phone on focus to the 6 gb ram, 128 gb storage, 48 mp camera & 6000ah battery.

Apparently Samsung does. This pathetic piece of plastic does not support for 5GHz wifi.\n\n", "\n\n  Dear friends, believe me. Don't waste your money on this phone. This is the worst phone I have ever purchased. It is slow and hangs often. The network connectivity is very poor. My Jio 4G sim, which was working perfectly on my old phone is miserably slow on this phone. For watching YouTube videos, you have to wait for minutes for the video to load. I can't believe such a miserable phone can come from Samsung. And to crown it all, there is no option for return...! You can only request for a visit by the Amazon expert. I don't believe it will do any good.After two weeks I exchanged this rubbish with a Realme phone on Flipkart. I lost around Rs. 5000 on this deal, but it is better than suffering such s miserable thing.

Front camera is too bad although it has 8mp. Main camera has 48 mp. But still there is no night mode, continuous shots panorama options. I used to have all these options in my earlier samsung mobile which is a 3 years back model. Mobile gets heated very easily although I just use it for calls and little browsing . Display is not amoled so dont expect much quality here.Phone is too heavy to keep in pocket also. And finally amazon is not replacing phone although we complaint on the first day of receiving it, they simply arrange a technician visit in the last 7 days they arranged visit for 3 times . But no technician visits simply they call from Gujarat when mayne is Hyderabad and simply say we will replace mobile but to amazon they say everything is fine and close the ticket. So finally understand that these technicians are nothing but amazon employees only and Amazon I'd dragging till the replacement deadline ends . They never gonna replace mobile also leave about return.And finally this is my first mobile bought in Amazon. Till now I used to buy in Flipkart. I never had any issue with Flipkart. I decided not buy any electronics in amazon from now onwards. Finally I felt I wasted around 9k on this shit model from Samsung and buying in the great indian bluffing sale of amazon.

I bought it as second phone(I use iPhone SE 2020).With normal use more then 48hrs still 44% battery leftFingerprint sensor is unbelievable it’s so quickCamera is decent enough to capture picturesDisplay Quality is GoodOverall I felt good for buying it for 9999/- with ICICI credit card offer.It’s worth buying, it’s far better than other MI with same price (10999-12999 in 4GB -64GB ) as Samsung don’t irritate with adds and also more secured\n\n', '\n\n  I got this M12 (4 / 64 gb and 6000 battery) as an upgrade to the M01 Core (1 / 16 gb and 3000 battery) phone, in the hope that it would be better ... BUT:1.  battery despite being double the size does not last any longer ..... 50-60% after only1 day of light use (I dont do any social stuff, only 3-5 talks and 1-3 messages per day);2. the ringtone and message notification choice is very poor .... had to import from the old phone;3. could not download ringtones directly to phone, but this may well be more of a problem related with Google;4. software is not friendly, even after 1 full day of struggle, have not been able to locate / access storage card;5. was very happy with the 1 / 16 gb in my earlier phone and never had memory usage beyond about 60%, but this guy eats up more than 2 gb out of the 4 gb RAM even to start with even after i have uninstalled most of the "apps";6. one of the reasons of purchasing this was for its USB teethering, which works fine.Bring back the good old button phones (with proper software as 15 years back, and with some improvement in screen / pixels) and get rid of the bloatware.Think.\n\n', '\n\n  Look, feel and finish of the phone is good and up to the standards of Samsung. I am a frequent traveller and caller so was looking for a budgetary phone which has most of the features along with good battery backup. This meets my requirement.Pros:- Fit and finish is very good- Good battery backup- Performance is good with fast response- Storage and ram is sufficient as I opted for 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage variant- Responsive finger printing sensor- Loud and clear sound with and without speaker for calls- Clear voice callingCons:- Heavy weight makes it difficult to hold and use- The screen is HD only. Not even FHD but supports 1080 p video viewing- 4 K videos will never play in 4 K mode. Only can be played in 1080 p resolution- No gyroscope and magnetometer sensor which means, compass application and some games which use these sensors will never work- No Corning Gorilla class. Screen is prone to scratches without cover- Sound is below average for music listeners- Double tap doesn’t work to wake up the screenConclusion:Only go for this if you are using for phone calls with good battery backup. Not worth for entertainment purpose. I can still survive on this as I have an iPad for entertainment. Samsung is marketing it in such a way where none of the sensors specifications and entertainment features are mentioned clearly on the website as it is not having any of them. It’s a true calling phone !\n\n', '\n\n  I gifted my mom this phone in November 2021 and got a better discount for 64GB. Overall it is good, even i feel the size is big but its not that broad while holding it in your hands. Screen quality is good, Camera performs really well in daylight, in low light it suffers a bit and pictures are not that clear and color is also not that accurate. Battery is very good, it goes for more than a day and half (As usage is off-course not that much) but considering the price i believe this is a good choice, Samsung has some bloat ware which you can avoid by unchecking the boxes while setting up at the first time, or delete the apps after your first setup. Rest no major complaints, charger is not turbo charge but it does it work as expected. Thx\n\n', "\n\n  This phone is amazing for the price. Phone runs smooth considering it's a Exynos 850 Octa core processor. I like the 90Hz screen and I keep it ON all the time.  The fingerprint recognition is extremely fast and reliable. It has a decent camera, the battery is long lasting. The only deal breaker is that it doesn't support 5GHz Wi-Fi. Android 11 with One UI 3.1 is clean and very responsive and runs smooth without stutter or lag. One can avoid ads and bloatware if you setup the device carefully. I haven't seen a single ad on my device and I have been using it for almost 3 weeks.It's the best budget phone for the features you get.

Processor (heating issue, sometimes heats up without any reason maybe because of background process), 4. Ui lags, could be more optimized, 5. Display (samsung could have given atleast ips panel), 6. Charger(15w charger is not sufficient for a 6000mah battery) 7.

Only downside are its heavy, but you get use to it and the screen quality. Yes, side by side my other Samsung its a let down, but of its own it's absolutely fine. So, if high quality OLED is must for you then get the one of the other models.Rest no hang issues, does not heat, brilliant battery (as a backup phone on extreme power saver mode it lasted over 5 days!).\n\n", "\n\n  I got it delivered yesterday. So these are my first impressions after initial setupSize:This is a huge phone. So if you have small hands this phone cannot be used single handed. If you need to use it single handed often, better go for a grippy case with a string or a ring case so it doesn't fall out. Or go for a small phoneSpeed:It is a bit slow, but you can get used to it. For the price range, it seems to have a decent performance.Audio:This phone is advertised as supporting Dolby Atmos but that's only for bluetooth or other audio devices. Not for the phone speaker. Which is kind of a shame. But the audio is not bad.Video/Screen:Blacks are not exactly black. But again, for this price you shouldn't notice those things.Colors are bright***The phone is country locked. So to activate any other country sim you must first use an Indian sim for 5 mins cumulatively.I have not tested the other features like camera, fingerprint sensor etc. Will update as soon as I do\n\n", "\n\n  This phone comes with a ton of garbage Apps pre Installed. Samsung appears to be partner with IronSource which is a mobile app advertising company and they will keep bugging you to install tons of non sense apps. Over 10 apps were installed on my phone without my permission or without me asking or agreeing to anything. I did not expect this from Samsung phones, I know this is the case with most chinese phones such as Xiaomi but figures even Samsung comes with such Adwares. I wouldn't have bought this phone if I knew it was an Adware phone. You have been warned.\n\n", "\n\n  I was looking for a budget phone but didn't want to exceed 10k mark.

After learning the product and it's  features, I find my choice is worth.I have no idea how the picture quality is coming different & good to first few pictures.I am happy with my purchase.Thanks.__________12/12/21 - not the value for money - Samsung Galaxy M12 (Blue,6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)Review is based on first three days use.Reason for this purchase - switching from MotoXForce, due to irreplaceable exhausted battery & incresed ROM need.Rating for Amazon as market place - 4/5. (good display of available options, window shopping, product information, product comparison, communication)Rating for product - Samsung Galaxy M12 (Blue,6GB RAM, 128GB Storage):One star out of Five - Utter poor camera quality - 48MP quad cam image quality is damn inferior than my previous 24MP MotoXforce image. So unimaginable from Samsung. I find Galaxy S3 images are so fine quality.Battery charging not as fast, as the listing claims.Battery life (6000mAh) - not in tune with expectation, ehausts sooner.Fingerprint reader -  not always recognising. (perhaps the narrow finger print sensor limitation)This is disappointing.I encourage you go for a better option than M12.Thanks.\n\n", "\n\n  Good one. Serves the purpose. Good phone in budget. Powerful longlasting battery. A bit bulky and a bit slower (compared to higher mid range phones) considering 6GB RAM but you can turn off the animations (by activating developer mode) to make it faster. Still very few apps r a bit slower but that is quite acceptable as it doesn't irritate. Getting 6GB RAM for INR 11500 is awesome. It is not that slow also. Camera is good but shutter speed is slower. Hence, u need to be very steady while clicking pictures in low light else they turn out to be shaky. Nonetheless, a very descent camera in this range. Very difficult to get 6GB RAM Samsung in just 11500. Overall happy about this purchase. Good if u want a phone around 10K. Much better than simply spending 20-30K for few added features. Good if u want a secondary phone for office use (checking emails, etc.). Good for kids online classes. Sturdy enough. If u want non Chinese phone and r getting 6GB RAM in 11500 nothing like it. Just go for it. No regrets. Loving this phone.\n\n", '\n\n  Packaging - Bad (Though the item was fulfilled, Amazon?). After few days of usage; okay phone. New software.The battery does not feel like 6000mah; last 24-28 hours on low to just mid-level usage.A heating issue with 20 mins of YouTube watch and a notification is displayed that the device will be automatically turned off due to heating (while charging).The overall company wants to earn with this without much bothering about the value proposition.\n\n', "\n\n  ( I have the 6GB/128GB variant and this User Review is on this model ) If you are a NORMAL User like me....who does not play any Games or doesn't use the phone camera much......and just use it to phone call, binge some movies or TV Shows or listen to some quality music, then this phone is EXCELLENT for Usage. Go for the 6GB/128GB variant as some of the RAM and STORAGE is already occupied by the system. The display is good for viewing too... not too bad. PROS I FOUND AFTER MY USER EXPERIENCE:1) Android 11 out of the box, ONE UI CORE 3.1 is awesome and simplistic.2) It has DOLBY ATMOS for headphones which definitely gives a difference.3) The weight and thickness is AVERAGE and you won't even notice anything.4) Fingerprint Scanner is working well and good.5) Some of the Motion and Gestures settings are really cool and useful.6) The HIGHLIGHT of this phone is the Battery, and for me it lasted completely for 3 days straight on normal calls and some youtube.The charging time is worth it for the battery duration. This phone will get updates till android 13 or 14, which is great. The Exynos 850 8nm Processor is working well in terms of speed and smoothness. The 90Hz Refresh Rate is great and I felt the difference in smooth animations.

A2 has dual speakers with better sound, and a qualcomm processor.The pros of M12 are : display is nicer, the battery is better, and the camera quality is better (don't like the auto play of videos in camera app, haven't found a way to turn it off yet).If I were to choose between the two, would go with Mi A2 (lighter, sleeker, faster, better sound).\n\n", '\n\n  Wonderful product.

When put earphone no icon show at above you can't know plugged in or not, power button doesn't off the flash light, 3 finger screenshot not working here, C-type charger so you have to take charger everywhere. OTG not supported,  heavy weight, Camera have very limited features like no timelaps video option, no grid view, no screen focus option.

Though the phone is not that sleek and on the bulkier side, but I think that makes it even more durable and solid. And Rs. 1000/- off on ICICI credit card was icing on cake. Forget other brands. Need not say anything else. Totally impressed. Bought another one in black for my daughter and she too is in awe, even though she was using an IPhone 6 S.

The screen response rate is pathetic and camera quality below par, not sure what they mean by 48MP camera. Don't take this phone even if someone offers it to you for free.

The smartphone display comes with a 90Hz refresh rate. Samsung Galaxy M12 is the only smartphone in this price range to come with this high refresh rate. Samsung Galaxy M12 comes with an adaptive refresh rate which means that the panel cannot be locked at a high refresh rate. The high refresh rate display functioned smoothly during scrolling through Facebook and Instagram. For some reason, the refresh rate on the Samsung Galaxy M12 is locked at 60Hz for the notification centre. Also, the 90Hz mode is turned off while using apps like YouTube. Despite the high refresh rate and HD+ resolution, the display on Samsung Galaxy M12 is not that sharp and vibrant. The brightness is also not great and you might face some struggle while using the smartphone under direct sunlight. The display is large enough for you to enjoy movies and also play games. The display also comes with an eye comfort shield which reduces the blue light from the screen and prevents eye strain.

But looking at the cost of the phone this feature is justified.- Supports normal and wifi video calling without any issues- Speaker sound is okay, same cost factor- Two features which I feel are thereal drawbacks.  Finger print sensor is from the  side power button which is just below the volume button so you need to press it very carefully else it asks for phone restarting or switching off.- Second is not a real major one but the phone is very heavy in weight.- Battery life is okay you may continuosly watch movie or videos or use phone for 6-8 hours, takes 2 hours for full charging. Phone gets heat up in 1-1.5 hours of continuous use.- Display is good- Face ID works better than finger print.- Call recording and voice calling are clear- Have port for ear phones.- Hotspot feature is okay because phone started heating up when I turned hotspot on.- No network issues with either of the nano SIM\n\n", "\n\n  To be honest i was totally skeptical whether i should buy this phone or not,  seeing so many negative comments, I took the risk and bought it..After using the phone aggressively for 2 days i must say as i read from the reviews that this phone Hangs on operation which is totally FALSE .Phone totally works fine. Having a refresh rate of 90Hz the phones doesn't show any delay, the UI is smooth battery is quite strong . Using aggressively at max only consumed 46% of battery in two days (discharged from 100% to 54%).The only thing that will disappoint you is its Camera Which works like a 6-8MP camera.Macro shots are not that detailed either.Front camera is just like having a 2-3 MP camera.Samsung should have uplifted camera quality when they mentioned it with 48MP camera.This phone will disappoint you in terms of camera quality.Rest the phone just works very well in terms of other configurations.\n\n", "\n\n  This phone is the best in this price range with best battery and camera performance. I would have more pleased if it had an amoled display . Surely Samsung had the ability to imply an amoled screen but they didn't . They could have used Snap dragon 600 series chipset instead of the exynos. But still this is the best phone under this budget. Better that A21s of Samsung . It's the best 10k budget phone now.

Screen : Don't read review of other people. You will never realize it's Oled or else. Screen is good.4. RAM. You will get pure 4GB free RAM with 4GB model. In Realme or Redme you will find  half RAM already full.5. Battery: Battery is too good. I used it full day after full charged. No need to connect to charger in the evening. Charged it next day when you feel free. Even it can play YouTube for half hour with only 2%  battery.6: FM : Fm recording available with good quality.CONS.1 If you play high grafic game for more than 1 hour than it will lag for 10 to 15 second.2 No screen recording. But you can download any application from Playstore or Samsung store.3 Not having magnetic sensor. That's why not good for traveller. It will not show you north direction.

This battery is so big that you can easily use it for 2days with moderate use.2. Very beautiful screen even though it is LCD. Samsung has not used any cheap screen. You can enjoy your Movies and Web-Series.3. Very good camera ultra wide mode is just so beautiful you don't need panaroma mode in this. Selfie camera is just awesome .4. You even get headphone jack.5. The screen is pretty big best for online classes and binge watching.6. I have played games like BGMI, CODM, NFS with ease.My final opinion is that you should buy this phone if you want to do online classes, play games, or if you want a phone with big battery or if you are a binge watcher. You can download almost 70 movies with ease.\n\n", "\n\n  I am a student  .first time I thought  to purchased a smartphone  from.my first salary . I waited for Diwali to get offer price .

Phone body: back panel looks like of plastic, it would have been better if matelic had been used.6: user interface: sometimes very hard to do something, like taking a screenshot. Could have been given some better option to do that.

In this budget, this is possibly one of the best offerings. In the world of Android,nowadays Samsung possibly has the best offerings in every price range.Camera is OK enough. At least OK for a 10k phone.Sound quality is loud and clear, with display of good quality. Ganes and consumption of multimedia is enjoyable.Interface is clean and multitasking is smooth. Charging is fast enough. Obviously, the best part is it's massive battery and power usage. With moderate use, it can easily go past 2 days and that is a big plus for people always on the go.In the 10-11k category, this is possibly the best I've used so far. This is a phone for ages to keep.Thanks to Amazon, delivery was in perfect condition.P.S. Before buying, even I was skeptical reading some of the negative reviews. I'm a common user, and my understanding is if you're expecting top of the line performance from a budget phone, then your expectations are to be blamed. Or most of the bad reviews are sponsored ones.If you want top of the line, you gotta spend top of the line.This phone gets the BASICS right, and that is what matters in the long run. And no phone in this category will offer a truly top class camera; even if they do,they will compromise in some other areas. Whereas, M12 with its 8nm efficient structure along with a Trusted Chip Set gets the job done in a smooth manner. Overall, if you want Smooth operations with Reliability, trust Samsung M12.\n\n", "\n\n  Battery life is so good  and camera quality  is average  like 13 mp. Front camera is like 2 mp.

How come this mobile will not provide dual band wifi, means I am getting low Internet speed with that single band wifi feature. Very much disappointed with this big drawback. Even lower price mobiles are giving this feature but not m12. Samsung smartly avoided by not mentioning this in the product description.\n\n', '\n\n  Seems like Im using 10 years back mobile. Its super heavy. Resolution is no good and I have eye pain. Camera is very bad. Yes they have given 6000 mah battery but it takes more than 2 hours to charge fully. And battery does not work like a 6k mah battery.Does not expect this from Samsung as they have huge market nowadays compare to Apple worldwide.\n\n', "\n\n  The phone is great. Good display and UI. Comes with 6000 maH huge battery. Charging is quick but 1 thing that comes as negative is the camera. The camera doesn't seem like 48 MP. It struggles in low light & the Front camera also suffers the same problem. You can certainly go for it if you are OK with below standard camera. Amazon delivery was excellent\n\n", "\n\n\n\n\n                    The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n  \xa0It is best at this cost from a brand like samsung. Display resolution is HD but it's 90 Hz. Battery life is awesome lasts 2 days. Camera is disappointing though. There isn't any gcam available yet. No silicon case in box. One UI is the best UI I have ever used yet. Fast updates. 15 Watt charger included takes almost 2 hrs for full charge which lasts for almost 2 days\n\n", '\n\n  As far as my opinion is concerned, the over all features are Ok. The drawback features are:1. M12 is out of Super Amolrd Screen.2. Back Fingerprint is more covenient than side3. Camera quality is not so hifi than other models4. S Bike mode should given, which will be helpful ehile driving..5. Charger model is different  than other M series Mobiles with battery of 6000 mah.\n\n', "\n\n  Purchased in June.What I like-Battery power. I charge it only once in 2 days. Being a medium-to- heavy user  it's a big thumbs up.- Storage capacity- Navigation speed- Not made in ChinaWhat I dislike- It's quite heavy!- Eyes hurt within 3 hours. It never happened with any of the phones I have  used so far (more than 10 phones ) . Some of them were really cheap too. I  don't know why this phone makes the eyes hurt. I am not a particular fan of  Eye Comfort Shield feature so this is a big minus point for me.- Camera here truly is just an accessory. Well, anyway, I didn't buy this phone  for cameras, my expectations were already low but the quality of pics are  even lower than what I expected.- Screen resolution.If you have other phones and want a budget secondary phone not made in China this one is good enough. I was sceptical about the performance of an Exynos processor , never used one before, but it seems alright so far.\n\n", '\n\n  I baught this phone but after 2-3days use i fill like its Display having some flickering issue then I Raised a Complaint. Then a Technician visited my phone and told me everything is fine. Them after 4-5 days later I again Feel Like Choppy And lagging problm and The Flickering issue. Then I called customer service they told me its out of replacement Policy. But when I insisted them they agreed to replace It. Now I am satisfied With the phone.Phone is smooth ( Just go in developer options and Set the animation scale to 0.5x Them Everything will be smooth)Battery is Monstar (6000MAH)Display have TFT panel But Samsung is Alasy winner in display department.Te display shows Deep Black not as Samoled panel but Better then (MI,Realme,oppo,vivo)Phone is Heavy but manageable.Cameras Are Decent enough For te Price range.I bought it for 8550/-I am happy 😊 with the device now.Now lets see What happen.I am writing the review After 15 days.Please check tw device Before buying.Thank You.\n\n', '\n\n  Got this phone @7749 after Exchange & bank discount at this rate no branded mobile may not come with Android 11..., so far is good still needs to check in all respects but all basic functions are working fine.\n\n', '\n\n  ProsExcellent Display for the price even if it is LCD (Samsung Expertise)Face ID with Fingerprint sensorOne UI is nice, smooth and feels modernUSB-C chargerLong Battery LifeConsPhone weights too high (more than 200 g)Samsung bloatwares are present and makes continued attemps to trick you for installation.Camera is fairly average, should have been little improved.No fast charging supportOverall good budget buy if you are looking for non Chinese budget smartphone.\n\n', '\n\n  I expected a lot about samsung mobiles in this price segment, but after buying it I totally regret myself.. But as a reviewer, I would like to post the pros and cons that I observed in this mobile..Pros:-1. Long Battery Life.2. Advanced features which are only available in Samsung ecosystem (like "do not disturb while in driving" etc.,)3. Can fastly unlock the phone using Fingerprint scanner.Cons:-1. Total Weight of Mobile.2. Camera quality is not seems like a 48MP Cam.3. Display quality is also not good.4. Face unlock is just an useless feature in this mobile.5. Last but not least, the worst thing is the processor. A walking turtle would be better than the performance speed of this processor..If anybody like to buy a mobile in this price range, just go with either Redmi or Realme.. Those brands will really satisfy you a lot (I were a Redmi user and I fully satisfied with the features, that\'s why I recommended this brand). 👍\n\n', '\n\n  I liked the phone battery last long even I tool 6GB ram version but the phone is little sluggish in performance may be the chipset is not great in performing daily task. But one UI is great even 120 he refresh rate I found phone performance not upto my expectations while comparing to my old redmi phone but I liked that unnecessary apps are not getting installed like redmi. Camera is great and battery life is awesome.\n\n', "\n\n  (Review it after using for a month)It's battery backup is quite impressive, camera is good but could be more simpler interface, I am not a gaming person but as per my Experience it's working smooth, but yes sometimes for a sec you will it might be slow but overall it's a worth Price product as of now.\n\n", "\n\n  It was very happy when I received it that I haven't spent money on China mobile but within 10 day I started regretting as it has started to hang very frequently and that's annoying. I haven't added extra memory card and using phone with only one SIM. Return policy was 7 days and it started hanging from 9th day :(\n\n", '\n\n  Such an awesome phone ruined by a biggest lack of a most important and basic feature, GREAT battery life, camera, UI, lives up to its reputation;Great specs all round, only thing to be vary of is that it DOES NOT SUPPORT 5GHz band wifi “5G wifi”When you buy a phone with such great specs, it’s a real shame that the only thing slowing it down is a lack of fast internet speeds due to hardware limitation. Not having support for 5GHz in 2021 is 🤮🤮\n\n', "\n\n  For this price - Nothing great to be expected.It's a low end phone.

My fear of receiving a defective model came true. The camera gives blurred, hazy images. Samsung is lying about 48MP, it is barely 2MP. The video quality is much better but photos are blurry. If you need to scan written documents, then this is a loss of Rs. 10,000+.  It cannot click clear images, you cannot read the document. The camera ONLY takes clear picture in the middle of the screen and blurs out everything outside that small circle. Not only the corners, the entire image is blurred except the center.The portrait mode is turned off, still the screen rotates on turning the phone.The phone lags and hangs, if you tap icons quickly and the text overwrites the previous position the text was in, and it takes good amount of time for it to reset.Horrible phone, horrible model. I saw same issues here in reviews but few photos were good and I took a chance that 48MP cannot be that horrible, but it is! Loss of Rs. 10,000. Now I see why these defective phones are sold under replacement only policy and not return policy. This is plain loot, to push defective models and get 10K from every customer.Never buying a Samsung ever again! Have put up a replacement request but Amazon will first send a Technician and as per his assessment, Amazon will allow a replacement or not, that is even worse. They never put this condition here at the time of purchase. Everything depends on this technician? Pathetic!!\n\n', '\n\n  Overall phone is ok. I have 6GB and 128 GB variant.Some advantages are there.1. In this Price getting good phone.2. Till now no heat or not hang.3. Till now Battery backup is good.4.  Video quality is also good.5. Good processor.Some drawback is there.1. Data cable is so small.2.  When charging no notification light is showing. When charge is full you have to check manually.3.

The battery life is awesome, lasts for 3 days once full charged with normal usage. The speed is also good, works well for daily usage. The camera is not the best does not feel like 48 MP.

It didn't happen in my previous mobiles even though they were less powerful than this device.- Although it has 4 cameras at the back, the portrait mode is completely nonsense. My previous phone had only 2 cameras on back yet it's portrait mode was a thousand times better.- Fingerprint sensor is on the power button and a real pain to use when you have a mobile cover.\n\n", '\n\n  I am writing this review after the usage of 25 days. It is one of the worst phones Samsung has made with multiple issues.  charging speed is very much disappointed , taking lot of time to charge up. The main issue I am facing is that the phone battery  is slow charging and quick battery draining.. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. 😡😡\n\n', '\n\n  Decent phone at 9,000 (after bank offers). The processor and display are not upto the standard. But given that this phone has knox security, I have little to complain about. This phone is strictly for old people who just needs a secure phone for day to day usage like messaging, calling, etc. Not recommended for any user who wants to do a lot of multitasking or gaming.\n\n', "\n\n  I buy this phone on Diwali offer for Rs9500 on 30 Oct 2021.For this price the phone is worthy enough..Now it been nearly 20days of usage..Pros..1.Best Battery life even in heavy usage it hold for a day its amazing...2.Rear Camera Shows the real face and color tone without additional filters in that way I love it..3.Display more than enough..90Hz Awesome4.Fastest FingerPrint Reader in this segmentCons...1.Front Camera not too bad as well as not good too..average for selfie lovers..but for me I like this one...Note it Mainly👇👇2.Processor or something make the phone lag...lag in popup the keyboard itself is not good....if it is a bug need fix immediately..3.Asking Updates for all the apps... may be it because of the phone launch day it was March 2021..I'm a Samsung fan So for me it is a better option for this rate..if you love Samsung buy it without the second thought...Apart all of the above the best phone for daily moderate users...OK for heavy usage(For Hours)...\n\n", "\n\n  I bought this for my mother. I ll just list what I don't like.1. Too heavy. Don't buy this for old people2. Camera is shaky and output is not great. I don't know why they have given four cameras.3. Too much of useless Samsung apps and galaxy items interrupting in between. I cannot able to disable these.\n\n", '\n\n  Samsung is cheating people with marketing big numbers for a product. All the specifications are just on paper.In reality, every specification is just sub-par.Camera quality is same as what you see in phones that released in 2012-2013, like Galaxy Grand 2.Battery is advertised as 6000mAh, but in actual, it gives the same result as a 3000mAh battery.Processor is just utter crap.Seeing a phone for the first where the initial setup itself lags like anything.Display quality feels same as resistive touch era phones.Screen shows bleeding symptoms.I wish they had a return policy instead of replacement.\n\n', "\n\n  This hand phone is perfect for those who want it for day to day use with decent gaming experience also security wise it is good one, actually before purchasing this phone i had watched so many videos in YouTube and amzon, After using it for some days I think it is very good for an average person but if you want to compare this phone with some other devices i think that you should avoid to buy this mobile phone also, if you have been using some high end devices for some times then also you should think before purchasing this phone. In my personal opinion i think this is very good phone with excellent camera and battery life, also performance wise it is good for day to day use. Itne kam daam mai Samsung ka bharosa aur NonChinese device wo bhi made in India. So go for it I'm sure this phone will not disappoint you.\n\n", '\n\n  Device is Heavy.Camera Quality is very poor.Screen Quality is very poor compare to othwr device in market.Fast charging is OkBattery backup is also Ok.I would recommend try other device in the same segment Like Redmi, Mi, Poco.\n\n', "\n\n  I had a lot of doubts before purchase on seeing the negative reviews lying here and there but my experience with the Samsung m12 was really exciting. It has good battery backup, the display, even though 720p is not bad to look at, screen brightness is optimum. RAM management is good for day to day apps. Haven't found any lags.  Haven't tried playing any games on it. The battery last for 2 days on normal usage and 1 day on heavy usage and takes about 3hrs to fully charge.  Over all it is a great phone. The true monster. Update: After using it for nearly 6 months I'm facing proximity sensor issue, which I found is common in midrange samsung devices because of which I'm planning to change the phone and never am I going for another Samsung device. There are minor stutters here and there even while using light apps like YouTube. The battery life is still awesome.\n\n", "\n\n  Hey so this is an honest review from my side. I thought Samsung phone would be great for my dad but it isn't so great. The battery life isn't good. Once the battery goes below 50% it drains really fast. Talking about camera quality, it isn't as good as expected. The pictures look grainy.. finger print reader doesn't accepts your finger sometimes, and if you put a cover on your phone then its even harder to use the finger print reader. This phone has good features but ya if I talk about the price it was good for 11k but not perfect!\n\n", '\n\n  Pros:Great Battery Life. Upto 2 days minimum.Great Camera.Superior smoothness in usability4GB RAM for multitasking.Built and feel of the phone.I use the phone primarily for clicking product photos for my website, and business calls. On a personal level, a powerful battery and camera saves me time and gives me a hassle free experience.  I use all sorts of video and image editing apps that requires a lot of ram usage and the phone has never crashed so far. Also does well for gaming. Hard core gaming may be sluggish. But for the price perspective, this phone is all you ever need.Cons:Face Detection  for unlocking — takes atleast 3 seconds to react. The fingerprint sensor is comparatively faster. But both is a little annoying at times.\n\n', "\n\n  Please do not buy this phone because Samsung Galaxy M12 phone generating too much heat with this I can not operate the phone in normal condition. I kept the order in return and the authorized technician came and he decided, the is phone working normal but the compliant was too much heat generates when it's in the handset, in this case, how I could not take calls and operate the mobile. there is no return policy and only replacement but that also not happened. I was very much disappointed with amazon's service and I lost 13499/- and my requirement not fulfilled.\n\n", "\n\n  Very heavy phone. Peculiar problem of Samsung phone always in hung state .if you want to use in outdoor in day time you can't see anything bon screen.  For screen shot you need to put an extra floating menu on screen which is very irritating. No compass app you can run on phone as it lacks the sensors. Friends don't buy it, Chinese phones are far far better than this. I also purchased it just to avoid Chinese phone and now I repaint it. Since sep 21 I am using it and this is worst phone I have ever had.\n\n", '\n\n  New year and Christmas day special status quotes wishes<a href="https://www.best-status.com/2017/10/best-10-happy-new-year-2018-gif-image.html"> Happy New year Gif image </a><a href="https://www.best-status.com/2017/12/happy-christmas-merry-christmas-status-wishes-for-whatsapp.html">Happy Christmas status wishes for WhatsApp</a><a href="https://www.best-status.com/2017/10/happy-christmas-day-hindi-status.html">Happy Christmas day Hindi status </a><a href="https://www.best-status.com/2017/11/happy-christmas-status-and-merry.html">happy Christmas status Gif image picture </a><a href="https://www.best-status.com/2017/12/happy-new-year-and-merry-christmas.html">Happy new year and merry Christmas status</a><a href="https://www.best-status.com/2017/12/romantic-new-year-2018-statusmassage.html">Romantic new year status massage </a><a href="https://www.best-status.com/2017/12/happy-new-year-2018-gifs-animated-image.html"> happy new year Gif image picture animated </a><a href="https://www.best-status.com/2017/12/happy-new-year-2018-romantic-love-image.html"> happy new year romantic love status</a><a href="https://www.best-status.com/2017/10/happy-new-year-2018-shayari-in-hindi.html">happy new year shayari in Hindi </a><a href="https://www.best-status.com/2017/12/happy-christmas-day-2017-3d-gifs.html">happy Christmas Day 3d gifs </a><a href="https://www.best-status.com/2017/10/best-merry-christmas-status-quotes.html"> merry Christmas status quotes </a><a href="https://www.best-status.com/2017/10/merry-christmas-status-happy-christmas-status-quotes-best-merry-christmas-status-saying.html">merry Christmas status quotes saying </a><a href="https://www.best-status.com/2017/12/top-15-happy-christmas-day-gifs.html">top 15 happy Christmas day Gif images </a><a href="https://www.best-status.com/2021/11/happy-new-year-2022-gif-animated-image.html">happy new year 2022 Gif image picture </a>\n\n', "\n\n  1-Camera Quality too poor back & Front both2- battery life is too short 8 hours3- unable to take screenshots4-phone hang while typing5- for PUBG lover Don't Buy not working in properly6- Display Quality is so ugly while playing game 🎯🎮7- mobile heating while charging & using tym both8- It's taking 3-4 hours for charging\n\n", '\n\n  While Samsung boasts about the 48MP camera, the picture quality is not up to the mark.

No fingerprint smudges.I have experienced some jitters but nothing to complain about. Calling over WiFi facility works very good and the earpiece quality is decent. No issues with proximity sensor.

Go for it.\n\n", "\n\n  I have gone through many reviews for this phone. But, I've not seen anyone talking about sound quality. Maybe their handsets are working absolutely fine.. Maybe my particular handset is troublesome. Anyways, since I got the phone on my hand, I couldn't explore as much as I should but overall my experience with Samsung is not up to the mark. I purchased Samsung's phone hoping to get some amazing performance which the company and other reviewers (mainly YouTube reviewers) claim.I am not that technically sound person to digest every single term the phone companies (manufacturers) use these days. Still, I've gathered a little bit of knowledge and experience after using various smartphones over the long 11-12 years.I got this model (Galaxy M12) exchanged with Redmi 8A Dual which was not that much worse.. The sound was pretty loud be it media sound, ringtones, call sound, etc.Frankly speaking, I've not checked gaming, camera and other features the way I did with sound quality. I'd recommend experience yourself before you buy this phone if at all possible.\n\n", "\n\n  Good phone for the price. The responsiveness of the screen to touch is a little wanting. Battery not as good as expected, lasts for about a day and a half with moderate usage.  Camera is great but it's a pain to select and toggle through the settings.

Camera quality is very very poor. Phone hangs too much like if i unlock the phone it takes more than 10-15 sec to display clock, navigation icons, notifications panel etc. Phone heats up if we use gdrive, maps, hotspot. Screen and body is very delicate. Plz think much before you go for this. An upset frustrated Amazon cusromer, Sameer!\n\n', '\n\n  Its a budgeted phone. 6 GB/ 128 GB storage variant is good.

If you are a high range user mobile price of above 15000 then this will be little low campares to that m12 but m12 gives it own best Performances.You can't  compare this mobile 10500rps  to the mobiles above 15000 because  if you put plus money then it comes with  more features  that's the difference..so you must compare the features with price tags then scroll to the reviews  for performance of the mobile  like you and me! Conclusion:-  Review is only for this mobile so...this kind a features with this price is absolutely  worth it. Performance  was damn good of every features and last Final finger print sensor is a exotic feature in this mobile the it works is like DAMN GIRL!Thank you.\n\n", "\n\n  I have just picked it up in budget category for day to day needs, well I'm not disappointed with my choice it's a great package to offer at this price point keeping my needs in mind.However the phone is very sluggish in response, if you're looking for performance from this phone kindly stay away it will disappoint you.Hope my review helps prospective buyers.\n\n", "\n\n  After using since 5 days......1. 90Hz display really smooth2.

I tested the Battery life and for a heavy user, it can easily last you and day or a day and a half. And for a light user, it can last you 2 - 3 days! Also, the cameras are decent, the front camera is ok in low light or in some cases indoor lighting, but the front camera is pretty good! I have seen phones with these exact same features for double the price! The screen is respectable it's not pixely, but it's not the best ofc. The screen is pretty smooth, its 90hz is really nice and smooth. Gaming on this phone is ok. I mean like I told you the battery can last you a long time, and the same thing applies to gaming now ofc the battery will run out faster but not significantly faster. Playing the actual game its self is decent only the VERY high-powered games is a bit laggy on this phone but most of the games work smoothly. I would give this phone a 4 star just because the front camera could have been better.\n\n", '\n\n  1) Look and feel of the mobile is good but little heavier due to 6000 mAH battery.2) Camera quality is good but slow - takes more time to save the picture.3) Fingerprint reader is good.4) Overall performance is slower.5) Battery support - 2 days under normal use.\n\n', '\n\n  It got deliver on 14th April.

But really.... I am astonished with its battery backup. It\'s a huge for phones in this price range. It comes with 6000mah battery which I felt, a #monster precisely😳. The camera....OMG!!!!!its just too good. It comes with 84mp quad camera . It has a 10x zoom, which is super clear. The fingerprint reader is mounted on the side,down the volume button. It\'s too awesome. It  senses the print, even on a thin plastic sheet is placed on it. Other than all this , to say, it a great budget friendly and a must buy on the other hand. It should be in one\'s list , if he/she is looking for the #monster in 10k bracket💯👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼\n\n', '\n\n  1.

Display could have been much better. But won't notice Unless you compare it side by side.For 10k it's a good buy for a light user.If you're a heavy user.

Battery life is the best part of this phone, it easily lasts for 2 days with moderate usage and 1 full day if you are a gamer or a heavy user. It takes close to 2½ hrs to charge fully. Coming to the cons, the camera is just average and you will be disappointed if you  buy the phone for the camera. The 90hz is smooth.

There is no fingerprint sensor on the back with Samsung choosing instead to integrate it with the power button.good to see Samsung using a USB Type-C port for its affordable devices, and that is present at the bottom alongside the 3.5mm headphone jack and speaker grille. he display on the Galaxy M12 is a 6.5-inch HD+ (720 x 1,600) TFT panel that has a 90Hz adaptive refresh rate. In its price range, the Galaxy M12 appears to be the only phone with a high refresh rate. the display is a standard panel with healthy peak brightness, controlled saturation levels, and minimal colour shift when viewed at an angle. A quad-camera system is present on the Galaxy M12 which comprises a 48MP primary sensor with an f/2.0 aperture, a 5MP secondary ultra-wide lens with a massive 123-degree field of view, a 2MP depth, and a 2MP macro sensor. As far as budget phones go, the Galaxy M12 does a decent job of capturing details  At night, the camera is a bit inconsistent and a slight shake can induce blurriness in the shots. I keep my expectations about low-light photography in check from a lot of budget phones, but the M12 is above average and good. Lastly, you get a beefy 6,000mAh battery that is very likely going to last you two days on moderate usage.\n\n', '\n\n  after using the phone almost 4 months1. phone is not super fast what company is claiming infact it is slow sometimes.2.

My first full charge ran for full 3 days with moderate usage. Looks good . UI is simple with Android 11.  Weight and grip is good . Screen is responsive .

The camera is good but not excellent. Nevertheless the sound of loudspeaker is little down.

One of the biggest con is that it does not support 5GHz wifi.Overall, if you are looking for budget phone i would suggest better go for redmi note series.Even though it a budget phone it still doesn't justify its price tag.
