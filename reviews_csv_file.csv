0,"  Very disappointed with the overall performance from Samsung
"
1,"  Camera quality is low
"
2,"  Got the mobile on the launch date,Battery must be appreciatedCamera is just averageMobile performance is above average90hz refresh rate? If u r buying the mobile for this feature then I'm afraid u may get disappointed, it's just normal.The USB cable is too small in lengthIt's a good mobile in this budget, there are no returns for this,  only replacement is available, hence choose wisely before buying
"
3,"  1. It doesn't work with 5.0GHz WiFi frequency. 2.4GHz is very old school.2. Camera quality is pathetic (both front and back). Forget about 48MP, pictures are all blur, poorer than a 4MP one.3. Amazon didn't allow to write a review until they sold most of the stock, something very fishy.4. No return policy, you will have to live with the phone you didn't like. Now you decide.
"
4,"  Not worth buying....faulty software, poor display quality, single band wifi doesn't support  5ghz WIFI band. Gyro sensor missing and many more. DONT GO BY PAID REVIEWS IN YOU TUBE
"
5,"  I will never purchase Samsung phones. Phone is lagging too much and slow. Waste of hard earning money.
"
6,"  This is worst samsung mobile I have seen from samsung. It's sceen quality and colors are trash. Even a old 5000 rs phone can beat it's quality. Please never ever buy this product.
"
7,"  मोबाइल का कैमरा बिल्कुल भी सही नही है 48 PM बताया और क्लियरिटी 5 मेगा पिक्सल का भी नही है ।मोबाइल भी पुराना सा दिखता है ।इसको नही खरीदे
"
8,"  The phone hangs a lot and is very slow. I received a replacement which continues to hang
"
9,"  Very poor quality camera .Found box seal damage still Amazon not taking it back.waste of money.Phone very slow.Don’t buy from Amazon.Now Amazon started cheating customers to make profits.
"
10,"  Worst camera quality. It is like 2 megapixel camera. Photos are very worst. If you slightly zoom the photo,  you can see blurry...Previously I used 13 megapixel amera phone. Those photos are very good.
"
11,"  No 5Ghz wifi band on this mobile, miserable in 2021 , even my previous mobile of Samsung which I bought in 2017 have 5Ghz wifi , it's a big comedy
"
12,"  Don't received  handset ejection  pin  and manual.
"
13,"  very poor build qualityvery poor camera piclow quality phoneno return policyvery worst mobilejust making fool to customer by samsung m12 and Amazon
"
14,"  Just unboxed the phone.Seems to be a better one in this price segment as of now.Just checked with the camera & voice it seems good but one thing it's very heavy in weight may be due to battery.Hope samsung lives upto expectation.
"
15,"  Hitting issue
"
16,"  Worst product and low quality never expected this kind of product from Samsung even though it's having high end config. It doesn't look that way.Camera utterly disappointed. Never seen this kind of mobile in the recent past and more over if you buy this product you have to bare with it because no return/refund option according to return policy only replacement that disappoints even more. Advising don't waste money on this product.
"
17,"  Good battery. Heating while charging and using mobile data, camera below average with 48 mp true, looks like 13 mp. Heavy in weight and thickness (okay that 6000 mah) display is not good as other phones in this rage in terms of technology and display ratio. Overall below average in this price.
"
18,"  PHONE IS TOTAL RUBBISH.  Slowest to respond, Camera not at all good, abruptly closes down youtube and other applications on itself....AND THIS PHONE IS UTTER WASTE. CAMERA QUALITY IS BAD.Not at all happy with the product.I WANT MY MONEY BACK
"
19,"  This is perfect phone, good speed, decent specs and outstanding battery life. The look of the device is also attractive. Above all, the trust of company.
"
20,"  Very disappointing ,Samsung manufactured only 2.4Ghz support mobile in 2021 @ 13000 cost. Newer days below 10000 value mobiles also supporting dual band.I have purchased samsung mobile in 2018 will support 5ghz band, 2021 manufactured mobile will not support dual band  very shameful.This is cheating of amazon not mentioned same in details about the product. I am suggesting don't buy those who are using Jiofiber WIFI.

Mobile manufacturers are clearing stocks, Need to inform 5G mobile support 4G band but all 4G mobile will not support 5G.Take example, if you purchase 20,0000 mobile today, after 20 months you may need to change to 5G mobile hence it will cost you 1000 per month (costing matters) and you will not get High exchange value (not even 50% cost), Currently 5G yet to come in India, may be yearend or come will be high cost.Points to Remember while purchasing Mobile:1) Mobile band support, Dual Wi-fi Support is better.2) Graphics PPI matter hence check PPI value of mobile. It directly related to Mobile display and colour quality, Higher is better.3) Check Mobile camera F value (lower value, higher picture quality) if less than 1.8 is best. Mostly camera quality depends on Focal Value not on pixel4) Android upgrade support. This is important as your mobile will useless within 2 years, remember you don’t want any mobile who cannot upgrade to Android 11.5) Item Weight and height of mobile. Lower is better, it really matter as you will get pain while holding mobile for long time, specially  old people.6) Mobile resolution, Higher is better7) screen refresh rate, Higher is better8) Clean Android installation. This is also important as manufacturers cannot force you to install or retain any app.M12 /Pro6000 battery (not fully tested yet)Android 11, v11.0 operating system, One UI 3.1with 8nm Power Efficient Exynos850 (Octa Core 2.0GHz)90Hz screen refresh rateSamsung Brand (Non-Chinese)Galaxy Store supportDolby Atmos support.

"
24,"  Self camera is just like 2 mega pixels.
"
25,"  Product specifications are not at par..Display is below average.Camera quality is just okay..It doesnt support 5ghz wifi, which is not mentioned anywhere so please make sure before buying..
"
26,"  The user experience is pathetic on these cheap phones. Its filled to the brim with bloatware that you can't remove.You're better off getting the Mi phones as they have a far better UIAlso, I can't return this garbage of a phone as Samsung don't list this as a software issue.I'll have to look into installing lineage os and de-google this phone before using it but that's easier said than done.
"
27,"  Just for name sake Cam & Battery are 48mp & 6000mah. But coming to reality it is poor. The weight of the phone also almost 250gm so it is not a smart phone it is a hard phone. And the top menu bar beside front cam is not responding sometimes.
"
28,"  Horrible product
"
29,"  A very satisfying  experience with the device so  far.Pros:1. Long battery life-  I am a moderate  user who does everything  except gaming. That said , the battery lasts up to 2 full days.2. Decent cameras for the price. Pictures are satisfactory but could be better.3. Very responsive finger print sensor.4. Good sound quality, although dolby's impact  is not much pronounced5. UI is great and snappy. Lots of customization options.6. The display is good and smooth with 90hz refresh rate. It does make the difference.7. Fast charging works fine.Cons:1. The weight of the phone is on the heavier side @ 220 gms2. The display could have been a full HD+ @ 1080p3. No led notification light. All though there are apps that can do the job on an AMOLED screen.Overall, a good package.
"
30,"  Not a good mobile.Quite heavy in weight, you will obviously feel it. Weight is 220 gms which is far exceeding acceptable range. Can definitely be used as paperweight.Nothing special in screen, processor or camera also.Just a marketing gimmick by samsung.Stay away.. At 13.5k we deserve far better than this.
"
31,"  Pros:1. The biggest advantage for buying this phone is the battery life. 2.Going to the body of phone it is a very greatly built it comes with the matte finish it makes the phone Look really good.Cons1. You are choosing this phone because of the four cameras then you are wrong. Because it doesn’t give any clarity even it is with the selfie camera also. the camera is not up to the mark.2. The processor is also not up to the mark because when I use this phone for 2 to 3 days in starting I just saw off in different apps and sometimes it was struggling3.The display is also not up to the markSo my general suggestion is if you’re choosing this phone for general use with having a good battery back up then you can go with itbut if you are choosing this phone because of seeing the quad cameras then you’ll be left with nothing.Thank youI hope you all will like my review
"
32,"  This is Samsung's worst phone and it hs many glitches. Samsung doesn't even cleverly keep this phone on exchange deal because it wants to push this flop phone. The settings screen automatically come on home screen randomly on any other thing that is playing. Its camera is less than mediocre. Sound quality is bad. Only redeeming feature is battery life but then who wants long battery is everything else substandard. I want to return this but there is no such option. I want to exchange it for another model but there is ni such option either. I think Amazon and Samsung are taking us for a ride. We customers must raise our voice against such malpractices. Amazon is also allowing substandard, unverified sellers to peddle junk with misleading photos and information.
"
33,"  It's a real monster. Everything is awesome from display to processor EVERYTHING. Fingerprint works very fast. Battery life is also really huge. Those who are not in favour of camera quality they're wrong camera quality is just awesome, size of pic goes more than 20MB from main 48mp camera. Must buy product. Really happy from it 😌. Once again no complains regarding anything.
"
34,"  Camera is very poor.. though they mentioned 48mp but it looks like 13mp
"
35,"  I am giving this review after usage of 2 daysI bought this phone only for two req 1. Battery and Camera.1. BatteryBang on it lasted for 1 and half days there are unnecessary apps pre installed please remove those one of them is Takatak and Snapchat those are  absolutely non sense.I played Call Of Duty for straight 3 hours non stop battery drained from 98% to 80 %2. Camera is decent its ok to have good clicks from this phoneLast but not least Its Made in India!!If anyone is looking for Battery phone just go for this
"
36,"  Look is average. Battery life is good. Only go ahead if you just need a good brand name otherwise 100 of options are available in market. You will definitely get disappointed with camera which is actually not more than 12 mega pixels.  This phone nothing but a PowerBank with 12 mp camera attached. Samsung must call back these phones as it is definitely going to kill the brand name. I will highly appreciate if Amazon has the guts to publish this review. This is an open challenge to Amazon...
"
37,"  Disappointed with this mobile.... PhonePay & GooglePay apps are not working properly.... Numbers visible only half and getting overlapped....and we're end up typing wrong Pin numbers.... multiple times we have changed the Pin for these apps... now a days We regularly use mobile for online payments but this mobile is not useful for online payments due to app issues.We have tried to return this mobile, but Amazon return policy date was over by the time we found the issue.
"
38,"  I am using this phone for the last one week and i noticed few positive and negative things about it.Positive points -• Fingerprint sensor is so fast and i loved it• Battery backup (6000 mAh) is amazing even after using it throughout the day• Camera quality is really good and the pictures are amazing on day light• Large display having a size of 6.5 inches and can run games smoothly on low graphic settings• 90Hz refresh rate feels so smooth• The phone doesn't lag or get heated after using it for a long time because of Exynos 850 (8nm) high-end processorNegative points -• Not made for hard-core gaming because the processor is not strong enough to run games smoothly on high graphics• The weight of phone is heavy• The brightness level is somewhat low as compared to other phones• The display that you will get is around 720 x 1600 pixels• The downloading as well as uploading speed is also low as compared to other phones within this price range• It is not water resistant and does not have Gorilla glass for screen protection .~ I am satisfied with this phone because of it's camera quality and battery backup √
"
39,"  The phone is good looking, but it doesn't support the 5G wifi due to which the downloading speed is very limited2ndly the camera is not uptonthe mark . 48 MP is around 18 MP3rd. THE PHONE takes hell lot of time to get charged .No handsfree in the box
"
40,"  Changing my review on this device after 2 month usage .  I finally have to say that this is the bang for the buck .Awesome battery life , and that's what I want . I am just using it for basic social media and calls .. rest of my heavy work is done on my primary device .CAMERA is average , My ipad's 5 MP camera shoots better than the so called ""true"" 48MP.My advice-- go for 6gb variant as 2.5 gb is acquired by the system .Overall - 4☆
"
41,"  They have conveniently skipped mentioning it is not an amoled display while mentioning 90 Hz refresh rate. Touch response is faulty on these phones and SAR value is high despite having exynos processor, which also they have conveniently skipped mentioning.
"
42,"  This phone has 90hz display, but I see a lag while browing or navigating in apps, doesn't feel like 90hz at all48MP true cam when option selected gives noisy images , otherwise in normal mode works above averageBattery is excellent works for 2 daysHeating issues occur on heavy usage, in normal mode you won't notice itFront cam 8 mp just averageOverall I took 6gb 128 gb version for 13k and doesn't seem as good.Above average phone for the price....

"
44,"  I bought the phone for my mother. Her usage is limited to making calls, the phone stays idle all the while. She had one more requirement that I shouldn't have to recharge it regularly. Hence choose this 6000 mAh battery phone. I was happy first few days, it gave 4+ day battery life but then an update came and spoilt everything. In 12 hours it would discharge completely. I approached the customer care and the customer care took remote access and checked logs and said, I see everything healthy in device. I told even though your log shows everything right, that doesn't translate to what I physically see. I probably had conversation for almost 10-15 mins but he was always coming to point he is not seeing problem. This was my first experience with samsung phone and this will be the last. And reason is not because product was bad but the customer support is pathetic. If I get into this kind of situation with their other products as well within a week or few weeks, I would simply waste my money. I am feeling lucky that I did not buy any of their exorbitant product and learnt the lesson at lesser cost.
"
45,"  Don't know if I could get more disappointed by a purchase!!The phone did look okayish in the spec sheet. But it is a very  stupid buy.The first thing you notice is  the IMPRACTICALITY of the phone.It is too heavy(220g) and too thick (about 1cm) to carry. The display is the worst anyone could get at this price point.The processor is reasonably slow. Face detection is a joke. Battery is 6000 mah but will take forever to charge. But the side fingerprint sensor was good .Camera was okayish. Add a few more bucks and buy a better phone with OLED display.
"
46,"  Amazon hid all reviews for first few days till most of the stocks are sold out. Then after that it is not allowing to write negative reviews. I wrote my experience with so many negative points and it rejected. Still I am writing the pros & cons again.PROS:▪︎UI 3.0 is amazing. I like it a lot. It is better than Redmi, Moto, Nokia UI. (Subjective)▪︎Amazing battery life. I am getting more than 24hrs of usage after fully charged.CONS▪︎Worst camera ever. True 48MP is all bulls**t. Low light pics are also worst.Front camera is also not good.▪︎Seriously??? No Slowmotion, Timelapse & other basic features in camera.▪︎It doesn't support Camera2Api which means I cannot download GCam.▪︎Worst Screen resolution. While everyone is giving Super Amoled display & Full HD display, what happened to you Samsung??▪︎90Hz refresh rate is just gimmick.▪︎8nm processor is also waste.▪︎While all others are giving Snapdragon processors, Samsung is stuck with its Exynos which is basically useless. Phone is hanging sometimes.▪︎Phone is a bit heavy and you'll have a hard time with its weight. It's like holding a powerbank.▪︎15Watt charger?? Samsung...upgrade bro.▪︎Wifi only supports 2.5GHz band and no 5.0 GHz bandFinally dont get decieved by True 48MP, 8nm processor, 90Hz refresh rate and other gimmicks. You will be disappointed. I am very much disappointed. The worst thing is there is no return option in Amazon. Amazon bro...you too planned everything so well. Good job.
"
47,"  Good phone in decent budget .Display could've been better , 90hz is not true to my usage . Since i use op7T it's clearly evident this display lacks the precision which it is said it has .Samsung India : they call me daily to inquire whether i have posted a review and what star rating should i give to the phone . This has become a headache .Dear samsung team , please do not force customer to write reviews and try to reduce the bloatware and unwanted app installations . I am starting to think MIUI was better than this .Display : not that they said / averageCamera : average / specs doesn't meetPerformance : ok for normal useBattery : good .Call quality : goodUI : Poor ,  I will not recommend samsung , this is not the one UI it was when i purchased M30S . Now this is full of bloatware and unwanted apps are getting installed by samsung store . I am puzzled on how to stop this.Overall : Very average phone . Better go for redmi note 10 or any other better phone in this price segment .Not a value for money dela
"
48,"  I recieved the phone today and observed that it is lagging a lot unlike like other Samsung phones. Considering it has 6gb ram it should not be hanging at all.Camera quality is terrible.Lots of heating issuesDoes not connect to 5ghz wifiOnly replacement option available for the product and not refund. So choose the product wisely only after reviewing the feedbacks.Bad network quality. Does not catch mobile network.
"
49,"  Good- got it for 9999- decent phone for this cost with all the necessary gizmos and bling- finger print sensor is good. fast and sensitive. Haven't tried the face unlock.- display is top notch on any good Samsung phone for this price- quality pics/ decent ( note - I'm a normal user of camera )- battery is very good. its really a monsterBad ( depends on perspective )- slightly big for small hands- it has all the dumb samsung apps inbuilt ( you can uninstall a few )- slightly heavier when you have a good solid case ( read as spigen branded )Overall very happy to have a good ( more than decent ) phone for the initial offer price.
"
50,"  Being die hard fan of Samsung it is very difficult to write this review.Camera quality:why say 48MP  when it doesn't even look like 13MP my Mom's Samsung  M10s  camera quality and screen quality are far better than this phone. Regret for buying this phone for such high price booked on first day of launch as it came from Samsung brand. Generallyi go by reviews  but first time ordered on  launch day becoz of the reliability.I regret for the decision i made. Do not recommend the phone for anyone.

54,"  Plz do not buy this mobile.. I am facing poor network issue. In my home others are using without any interruption.. Tried many things.. Asked colleagues, neighbors, mobile store person, google and tried all the ways.. But internet is very slow.. The same sim is working fine in other devise in same location. Even internet is ON it is showing you are offline when i try something. Also took nore than 45 mins to download 72 mb size app. Atlast i cancelled and came out due to intolerance. I am placing return order, will see what is gonna happen.

58,"   I had received this phone on 09th May 2021. For first two days it worked ok. (OK because this phone is very slow)BUT on third day, 12th May 2021, it was hanged very badly. It was neither getting switched off nor restarted..!!Immediately I have contacted the customer care for its solution. The Amazon representative has responded well and helped me to book technician's visit, which has completed on 15th May 2021.Amazon is ready for its replacement according to their 7 days replacement policy and hand to hand replacement.It was a traumatic condition for me as I have bought this phone in this COVID pandemic in very urgent condition and I badly need a phone always working 24X7 as my family was admitted in the hospital.Also, people who wish to buy it for its Camera then please beware as Samsung is advertising it as TRUE 48MP QUAD CAMERA but its result is like 8MP blurred one.Second thing is the phone is very slow and its UI is frequently NOT WORKING.Third thing is its speakers are giving old radio kind of noise.Luckily, there is no option for rating it ZERO or NEGATIVE star, else I would definitely give that rating to this product.There is ""No Return Available"" and only replacement option is given by Amazon.Only positive thing in this entire incident is that I have bought through Amazon and got their prompt support.I am very much thankful of Amazon as they have replaced this faulty device with new one on 16th May 2021, means within one day after technician visit.Now, I am only hoping that replaced SAMSUNG M12 mobile may perform to atleast ""OK"" level, if not to ""GOOD or BETTER"" standard.Dear Samsung, I will edit my review with positive points if I found the replaced product upto the mark..!!
"
59,"  Decent phone.. people say VGA cam because they didn't notice that the aspect ratio for 48 MP camera.. 48 MP cam option is only for 3:4 aspect ratio..And yea its true that the wifi doesn't support 5G bandwidth..  but over all decent mobile for decent price, Got 6GB version for 11.300 using coupon and credit cardThanking Amazon, IndusInd and Samsung!Posted pics are Shot by me on Samsung M12,Those who dont believe they can ask me for Camera Settings.

61,"  Pros:1. Best Battery i.e. 6000mAh.2. Good Back camera.3. Good and very necessary features by Samsung One UI. (I bet you'll like it)4. Good Performance (I use a lot of apps in multitasking but I don't play games so can't review gaming performance).5. Supports 15WT fast charging.6. Display is good according to the price range. (Don't get confused on poor display reviews.)7. Side positioned fingerprint sensor is good. (In starting you can face problems if you are currently using a back fingerprint sensor)8. Low light image from the back camera is also good. One attached in the image.9. Currently(11/04/21- 15/04/21) this phone is available @11700 (effective price)using Indusind bank cards so it is a loot deal for now. (Lowest ever price for this phone)Cons:1. Very bad front selfie camera which is 8MP (If you are a selfie addict then avoid it)2. Phone is very heavy and big in size.3. Adaptive brightness is not up to the mark.4.Animations are a little bit slow.5. Contact searching speed in the contacts app is very slow.(Resloved after update)6. After every update they install MX Takatak, Moz like apps which you can uninstall anytime. ( I think to make this phone that much affordable they are trying few methods of Mi and other Chinese brands.)Result: Best phone with all the latest features in this price range. @ 11700 - 12500Important(For those reviews who are saying the phone is slow): Got to developer options(Search Google for how to enable it ) and then Set Windows Animation Scale to .5x, Transition Animation Scale to .5x, Animator Duration to .5x. (Earlier all 3 developer options are set to 1x that's why the phone seems a little bit slow).Update: After update Contact searching speed became very good.

62,"  The price of the product is OK as per the price bracket. However it was nowhere compared to my old VIVO V5. Made a mistake exchanging the phone.The phone is average...
"
63,"  Initially i given 4 star and after few months of usage can see the sound quality degraded and very feeble .. camera outcome is not that much quality as they promised in d specs ..Samsung average phone at average price to meet out china companies competency..My old reviewI have bought 6GB Ram phone as I am long time user of Samsung and downgraded from high end series to this M series. D main reason u need to go for Samsung compared to China model phones is the SAR .SAR for this phone model is 1.19W/KG which is within the 1.6 range .Sound quality okayPicture quality is okay and not badBattery draining not that muchEase of navigation good 👍Performance is goodThis phone comes with backside Matt finish and not glossy finish ..tats s only cosmetic changes compared to M31 series ..Over all okay 👌🙂 ..head set won't be there which they mention in the items that they will provide..Overall decent price 👌
"
64,"  I have Mo2s and this m12....better buy m12 you get better storage ram camera and finger scanner etc....record selling on Amazon...just checking performance...will give review after 1 month....overall good on specs....
"
65,"  Except battery life.. rest other options like camera, display , software are all useless. If Mobile size comes under 6 or 6'4 inch then it will be preferable for elder people(above 50 age). Over all it fails in all segments. Micromax in 1 is far better than M12
"
66,"  I have been using this phone for more than a week and below is my feedback.1. Excellent battery and its lasts for 2 days at least on normal usage.2. Phone performance is good for normal usage such as YouTube,  Facebook or watsapp and usual games.3. Look and feel is good, easy to use.4. Phone is quite I feel probably due to battery  capacity.5. Front camera is not good but back one is good. This maybe great for selfie  lovers.6. Phone doesn't hang when multiple apps are opened.7. Worthy product  for this price based on spec and quality.I have attached  the photos taken and also same pic taken using both front and back camera  to show  the difference.  Overall it's a good budget Phone with all nice features and excellent battery.
"
67,"  1. Mobile is heavy,2. Company has given 48 Megapixel Camera, but camera quality is very poor,3. Mobile is not slim, and it is very thick mobile,4. Screen size is narrower than image5. Never buy, this mobile it is the waste of moneyAs per Amazon Policy they are not ready to return the product, I have wasted my money on this mobile.
"
68,"  Genuine feedback after 1 week of usageGood things:Low PriceBad things:1. Battery drains very quickly..my old realme mobile was 3000mah battery but was getting me 1 full day and this phone is 6000mah Battery but drains by evening2. I am using 4GB ram and its very very slow and very lagging..very versatile very horrible3. Finger print scanner everytime i get error message could not detect correct impression try again4. It says 48mp true camera but i could not notice any difference from my old 16mp camera5. No cancelation or refund policy6. NEVER BUY FROM AMAZON IF NO CANCEL/REFUND OPTION IS THEREConclusion:Better to chose any oppo or realme mobile in this budget
"
69,"  I bought this phone mainly for my kids online class during this pandemic. We thought to connect the mobile with our TV through HDMI adapter so that our kids can see the class directly on TV. When we tried to connect this mobile with HDMI adapter we came to know that this is not compatible with the adapter since it's USB hub is 2.0 (Don't know why Samsung configures the old USB hub for it's new mobiles). We also checked whether this mobile is MHL compatible or not? but it's not.If you are buying this mobile only for personal use then it's a good mobile. But if you are looking this mobile for your kid's online class then PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS.
"
70,"  Samsung is the beat
"
71,"  The phone doesn't meet the basic expectations from at a 10k budget segment and I was surprised to find that the MRP is INR 15499. The camera is a false 48MP and not at all true and the sensor has a very poor performance. There is no support for 5Ghz Wi-Fi which is strange to find at this age of mankind. The speed and performance of this octa core processor is sloppy.The only thing good about this phone is the battery backup and the storage provided in the higher configuration. If you are buying this phone for a standby purpose, then it is fine and worth the money. If you are considering to buy this as a primary phone, take deep breaths and look further for better options in the same budget segment.Always check the manufacturer website for specification details before buying the product.

72,"  Had some expectations. Worst mobile experience. I might be happy if I have bought this phone 4 years back. Such a bad touch screen slogging performance. Nothing is good in this
"
73,"  Very bad product.I never think such a product will come from Samsung.It had 48 MP only for show.Photos are not clear .On checking the photo size I found that 12mp again I was astonished I contacted customer care of Samsung they told me to change the camera setting 48 MP then I got photo in 48mp the clear not better than previous one .It gives very low quality photo again.It was my experience.I had bought by dreaming photo clarity.Net work problem is usually Samsung problem here .The only better thing in this phone is battery and quick charging
"
74,"  After a long span of time say 3 years, im back to Samsung. Now, Samsung realise that selling their name is no more working and reduce the price at the level of other company to success in the market . I bought 6 gb one and very happy with it now.However,  as before, many of the inbuild apps irritating me which are not uninstallable.After using it for 3 months plus, let me give my fair opinion:1. Battery life makes me happy, but fast charging needs 2 hrs plus is little bit annoying.2. Camera must not be more than 12 Megapixel. As compared to my previous phone MI Note 6 pro, I dont see any better snap here.3. Finger print sensor is absolutely annoying. Most time i have to enter my password manually as FP sensor do not detect my fingerprint. How my previous phone MI Note 6 pro nicely detects my fingerprint and easily open phone has been missing here.4. As MAH is more, thr weight of phone is bit heavy. I dont know why Silicon cover of around Rs 99 approx cannot be attached here in the package!! I bought silicon cover from Amazon but lately arrived which cause my phone screeen crack due to fallen from my bed. If it was in Silicon cover, the Lcd must have been intact till now. MI 6 Pro had come with one extra phone safety cover but Samsung cannot.5. After two years , I come to Samsung again hoping much UI improvement. However, i found Samsung do not compete with even MI in certain ways. I need to put Alarm clock on, i can easily go directly to all clock setting by clicking wall paper clock in MI while this phone need me to go to the clock in menu and so. When a turn on torch, i can easily turn it off by pressing power button in MI while this phone needs me to open screen and tap on torch icon in menu manuallyAs off now, i can point out these points to ascertain my judgement. I will comeback after using a year if get time
"
75,"  Edit1: adding on after using it for a few months, the call quality is terrible and microphone is also not working properly, Please look after other ones, waste of moneyThough the battery life is great, the charge time is long. Don't buy it. The performance  drop is so exaggerated. We can't switch between  apps without waiting for 3 to 4 seconds minimum.  Camera quality is bad as well.Edit 2:Worst mobile I have ever bought. Never buy it. There are lots of bugs, wifi calling gets switched off automatically, Sim signal service are irritating. Bluetooth is of inferior quality. Lte settings change automatically.
"
76,"  This phone is great! Writing this review after 2 weeks of using.Battery, camera, display all are good...and Battery is 👍.  Here some sample of photos attached.Phone is little bit heavy..for that large battery.Processor is good for daily use...but not for gaming.  Phone 🔊 is also good.Thank you Amazon.
"
77,"  Amazon did a great job with the delivery of this product. Ordered and received on the same day.On the phone: I am happy with it. Have been using this phone for 3 days. The battery lasts for 1and half days with gaming and binge watching videos.The screen is comfortable. No issues on the screen, though  it is not amoled for an average user it is not a big difference.For the price this is a great buy, of course there is no snapdragon chip. But the exynos 850 is 8nm and at this price point is comparable to most snapdragon 6series chipsets.Camera is decent. As long as you are not a professional photographer,  this will be good enough to take atleast average if not great pics. (Some  pics are really great).This is definitely not an iPhone or one plus. But for the price it definitely is great.
"
78,"  Product is okayBut I cancelled order to get discount by paying for the same product by credit card.Disappointed that it was rejected.
"
79,"  This phone is not compatible with 5 GHz wifi. I have JioFiber which is having 142 Mbps speed but my wifi network is not visible in phone's WIFI.I called to Samsung customer care and he informed that this phone will be connected to wifi which is having 2.5 GHz.I am returning back this product.
"
80,"  Camera picture quality not up to the par! But considering the price range, it is acceptable!But no 5GHz band support! Unacceptable in 2021!!90Hz screen refresh rate does not feel like 90Hz!Lot of lag is present! Don't know if that is a software bug!Battery performance is good!!Speakers are good, as expected.Overall, except the WiFi dual band support issue, rest is acceptable in this price range!!
"
81,"  Recently I bought this galaxym12 for Rs.11k. Overall ok. But onething have to remember thst is thickness of the phone. Its 10mm THICK. Just like a brick in your pocket. Overall dimension of the phone also big. Hight , width, especialy thickness. Before i bought i didn't noticed the sizes of the this piece. Thats my mistake too. But u guys please concern about this review before you buy. Otherthan size completly ok at this price.
"
82,"  I gave it 4 Stars for the features that do work and not because it's a great phone. Considering price I paid for It I am reviewing it.Pros: Good Battery Life, Great Fingerprint sensor placement, Speakers are good as well for the price, Widevine L1 support with Dolby Atmos too. Storage is plenty with Expandability. Form factor I found good Too.Cons: Performance; sometimes it lags and the 90hzs is a gimmick, the UI itself is too laggy to notice it's smoothness. They went wrong in cameras too, just because they can afford to put a 48 megapixel camera doesn't mean it's good. The ISP is bad and makes even the bayered photos look noisy. I would suggest to use a GCam mod, then again I didn't find one that works perfectly for Exynos 850. Also other 3 cameras are just as bad if not worse. Shooting raw helps if you have the time to edit it later on Lightroom or snapseed.Also Noticed that the software adds background blur that looks unnatural, at f2.0 this should not happen at all.Get it for you parents.
"
83,"  Actually i brought this phone on focus to the 6 gb ram, 128 gb storage, 48 mp camera & 6000ah battery. Later on viewing the review of some customer i  was very upset & regreting myself. But when i received the item and my experience on the phone is 100% satisfy with the product. Awesome phone on this price range.Thank amazon & its seller partners, once more thank for courier partner too which help to delivery my item on time & safty.  Thank all
"
84,"  Don't get duped by this phone. The description of the phone does not describe wifi support anywhere. Who makes a phone without 5GHz support in the year 2021!!! Apparently Samsung does. This pathetic piece of plastic does not support for 5GHz wifi.
"
85,"  Dear friends, believe me. Don't waste your money on this phone. This is the worst phone I have ever purchased. It is slow and hangs often. The network connectivity is very poor. My Jio 4G sim, which was working perfectly on my old phone is miserably slow on this phone. For watching YouTube videos, you have to wait for minutes for the video to load. I can't believe such a miserable phone can come from Samsung. And to crown it all, there is no option for return...! You can only request for a visit by the Amazon expert. I don't believe it will do any good.After two weeks I exchanged this rubbish with a Realme phone on Flipkart. I lost around Rs. 5000 on this deal, but it is better than suffering such s miserable thing. Because of this cheating I am leaving Amazon.
"
86,"  In dis price u can afford M12 ...no doubt...overall excellent performance
"
87,"  Worst product by samsung.Don't buy this mobile.Very slow charging. In one hour charge upto 3 to 4 percent onlyDisplay is too poor qualityDischarge very fast . In a day you have to charge 2 timesCamera is very bad.
"
88,"  Very worst phone. Just waste of money and time. I did not any support from Samsung team and Amazon. The battery and charger getting heated up. When I call Samsung customer service they said as you have purchased from Amazon they will not support. Amazon team say that as this a Samsung phone you can call them. They are playing games and I was completely cheated by them. If you purchase from Amazon Samsung team no warranty for this product is only 7 days from the day of purchase.So be careful before you purchase the electronic from Amazon you can get cheated them.I have paid RS 11000 towards this phone.
"
89,"  Hi Guys, dont buy this mobile. Front camera is too bad although it has 8mp. Main camera has 48 mp. But still there is no night mode, continuous shots panorama options. I used to have all these options in my earlier samsung mobile which is a 3 years back model. Mobile gets heated very easily although I just use it for calls and little browsing . Display is not amoled so dont expect much quality here.Phone is too heavy to keep in pocket also. And finally amazon is not replacing phone although we complaint on the first day of receiving it, they simply arrange a technician visit in the last 7 days they arranged visit for 3 times . But no technician visits simply they call from Gujarat when mayne is Hyderabad and simply say we will replace mobile but to amazon they say everything is fine and close the ticket. So finally understand that these technicians are nothing but amazon employees only and Amazon I'd dragging till the replacement deadline ends . They never gonna replace mobile also leave about return.And finally this is my first mobile bought in Amazon. Till now I used to buy in Flipkart. I never had any issue with Flipkart. I decided not buy any electronics in amazon from now onwards. Finally I felt I wasted around 9k on this shit model from Samsung and buying in the great indian bluffing sale of amazon. Thanks to Amazon and Samsung for your wonderful committment to customer. You keep loosing for sure many customers during to ur bluffing stuff.

90,"  ""Sir, I am really sorry however, M12 supports 802.11 b/g/n 2.4GHz.""- This is the response from Samsung customer service when I inquired why not able to detect to my Router 5G. Even 6K Chinese mobiles have 5G detection - so before you buy think and check as the mobile has very limited features. The battery life is not great while it is 6000.... and camera is very normal standard. The mobile as a whole is a big compromise to the cost and is not a value for money product.
"
91,"  Pros :6 gb ram128 gb storagePlus 48 mp back cameraHuge 6000mah batteryLooks are pretty good as wellFingerprint sensor is on the sideCons :Front camera is horribleScreen is not upto the markDue 6k mah battery it is little bit heavyOnly 15 watt chargerNo slow mo or other features in cameraConclusion:If you use it for general use, storage, binge watching it is a great phone but if u are gamer, photo addict, looks then it's not worth it.Although great phone by Samsung in this price range.
"
92,"  I bought this phone for reputed brand, 128GB memory, 6 GB RAM.But my bad nothing is working :- It buffers every 5 seconds in each and every audio, video including downloaded videos/audios.- Does not have 5GHz wifi singal acceptance. It shows only 12 Mbps for a 200Mbps fiber comnection for 2.4GHz wifi signal.- Mobile voice network is always low. Voice break always happens, where as all my other mobile works fone.- All applications are very slow and crashes. (Faulty software even after updates).- Sound system including ring tone is very low.- Hotspot goes off multiple times without any reason.- Battery backup 12-14 hours and takes too long to charge- No support from Samsung (Closed 3 tickets without responding)Please don't buy, you will waste yor money.
"
93,"  Very disappointed, single band wifi doesn't support 5ghz WIFI band. My 5years old Lenovo k4 note mobile able to connect 5g wifi.  Future is 5g. But this mobile not even supports to connect 5g wifi network
"
94,"  I bought Samsung Galaxy M12. Initially, the mobile worked good but for the past 3-4 days the mobile is geting heats up even without using and while charging it hets heats up.Since this mobile carried 1 year warranty for manufacturing device and 6 months warranty for in-box accesories including battery.I request Amazon or Samsung(manifacturer) to replace the said mobile at the earliest.

97,"   Battery life has just blown me away impressively... A great screen and a good processor... I play heavy games on it. I'm just loving it so much. 90 herts refresh rate at this price... Feels even better than my one plus 7 pro and I feel no difference between this and my s21 ultra
"
98,"  Cons-Camera is average.Display dosent feel as smooth as 90 hertz it feels just like normal display.Battery life is ok but not as per 6000 mah only last 1.5 days with moderate usage.Also samsung does not provide any back cover with this mobile so if u buy this mobile do purchase a backcover.Pros-Customisation of samsung is good...lot of themes to change the look of your mobile screen.Buit quality is ok.Sound quality is good.Fingerprint reader is fast.Don't trust Youtubers who are just marketing this mobile for sake of money....These people are biggest frauds.

99,"  I'm writing this review after using few days I must say samsung m12 is great phone  in  budget segment  compared to vivid v17 and realme 6pro that I'm already using  samsung m12 better backup  is excellent after 12hr using only 30% 0f better  used but I'm requesting  samsung  to do some important on all cameras  in next update  actually need some improvement  but  I must say in Rs.10999/  this the best samsung m12 phone if anyone thinking to buy samsung m12 please go for it ...but befor that few things I'm not happy with phone is1) network connectivity need updated as soon as possible2) Amazon, Amazon prime, flipkart and eew more apps not working bugs is their.3) YouTube also buffering after connected 6mbps speed network4) In the software I think lost of bugs are their need updat as soon as possible. from my side I like it very much thanks samsung for this budget phone  thanks Amazon for one day delivered
"
100,"  Absolute delight for a budget smartphone! Just ordered it yesterday and got it today within 24 hours. It has it all 6gb RAM 128gb memory. Further two sim slots and a dedicated mem card slot. It's got a 3.5mm headphone jack as well. Also it's got it's own 15w fast charger in box. That is amazing! It's MRP is 15499rs but was in sale in Amazon for 12499rs. A further 10% discount on SBI credit card so deducting 1249rs and another discount on EMI deducted another 440rs and finally got this beast of a phone for just 10803rs! Now isn't that something. Really happy with the purchase as it's for my dad. He too had something to smile about amid this deadly pandamic. Thank u Samsung and thank u Amazon!
"
101,"  No need to underestimate exynos 850, with 90Hz refresh rate.it’s not disappointed me. I bought it as second phone(I use iPhone SE 2020).With normal use more then 48hrs still 44% battery leftFingerprint sensor is unbelievable it’s so quickCamera is decent enough to capture picturesDisplay Quality is GoodOverall I felt good for buying it for 9999/- with ICICI credit card offer.It’s worth buying, it’s far better than other MI with same price (10999-12999 in 4GB -64GB ) as Samsung don’t irritate with adds and also more secured
"
102,"  I got this M12 (4 / 64 gb and 6000 battery) as an upgrade to the M01 Core (1 / 16 gb and 3000 battery) phone, in the hope that it would be better ... BUT:1.  battery despite being double the size does not last any longer ..... 50-60% after only1 day of light use (I dont do any social stuff, only 3-5 talks and 1-3 messages per day);2. the ringtone and message notification choice is very poor .... had to import from the old phone;3. could not download ringtones directly to phone, but this may well be more of a problem related with Google;4. software is not friendly, even after 1 full day of struggle, have not been able to locate / access storage card;5. was very happy with the 1 / 16 gb in my earlier phone and never had memory usage beyond about 60%, but this guy eats up more than 2 gb out of the 4 gb RAM even to start with even after i have uninstalled most of the ""apps"";6. one of the reasons of purchasing this was for its USB teethering, which works fine.Bring back the good old button phones (with proper software as 15 years back, and with some improvement in screen / pixels) and get rid of the bloatware.Think.
"
103,"  Look, feel and finish of the phone is good and up to the standards of Samsung. I am a frequent traveller and caller so was looking for a budgetary phone which has most of the features along with good battery backup. This meets my requirement.Pros:- Fit and finish is very good- Good battery backup- Performance is good with fast response- Storage and ram is sufficient as I opted for 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage variant- Responsive finger printing sensor- Loud and clear sound with and without speaker for calls- Clear voice callingCons:- Heavy weight makes it difficult to hold and use- The screen is HD only. Not even FHD but supports 1080 p video viewing- 4 K videos will never play in 4 K mode. Only can be played in 1080 p resolution- No gyroscope and magnetometer sensor which means, compass application and some games which use these sensors will never work- No Corning Gorilla class. Screen is prone to scratches without cover- Sound is below average for music listeners- Double tap doesn’t work to wake up the screenConclusion:Only go for this if you are using for phone calls with good battery backup. Not worth for entertainment purpose. I can still survive on this as I have an iPad for entertainment. Samsung is marketing it in such a way where none of the sensors specifications and entertainment features are mentioned clearly on the website as it is not having any of them. It’s a true calling phone !
"
104,"  I gifted my mom this phone in November 2021 and got a better discount for 64GB. Overall it is good, even i feel the size is big but its not that broad while holding it in your hands. Screen quality is good, Camera performs really well in daylight, in low light it suffers a bit and pictures are not that clear and color is also not that accurate. Battery is very good, it goes for more than a day and half (As usage is off-course not that much) but considering the price i believe this is a good choice, Samsung has some bloat ware which you can avoid by unchecking the boxes while setting up at the first time, or delete the apps after your first setup. Rest no major complaints, charger is not turbo charge but it does it work as expected. Thx
"
105,"  This phone is amazing for the price. Phone runs smooth considering it's a Exynos 850 Octa core processor. I like the 90Hz screen and I keep it ON all the time.  The fingerprint recognition is extremely fast and reliable. It has a decent camera, the battery is long lasting. The only deal breaker is that it doesn't support 5GHz Wi-Fi. Android 11 with One UI 3.1 is clean and very responsive and runs smooth without stutter or lag. One can avoid ads and bloatware if you setup the device carefully. I haven't seen a single ad on my device and I have been using it for almost 3 weeks.It's the best budget phone for the features you get. Doesn't look or feel cheap.
"
106,"  So far I ve no issues regarding the producr quality and delivery,it was gud...further comenting after using the product for a week or so...but as revealed above in the pictures,I think I ve got a used or already opened product,I mean whenever I ve bought the product from the store,I ve got it well packed and sealed(in a transparent plastic cover)but here....it is without any covering or seal.Thats why our family never likes to buy such stuff from amazon....flipkart is best for electronic items and gazettes
"
107,"  The build feels flimsy and cheap, I got one with a bent display. Unfortunately I never realised this defect until I went to pick up a back case and it wouldn't fit.Back at the Samsung service centre they said it isn't covered under warranty, and I should've returned it at the time of delivery.Camera is nowhere close up 48MP as claimed, pictures clicked with it are mediocre, to say the least.The only saving grace is the decent battery life.It's a good phone to stay away from though
"
108,"  This phone is mostly suited for multimedia, video, internet, office work.Pros-1. Good battery, 2. Connectivity, 3. Knox Security, 3. Design, 4. Price(because samsung mobiles are costlier), 5. Camera, 6. Durability, 7. Side mounted fingerprint, 8. Quick finger print reading, 9. Display (although it's a tft panel but picture quality is quite impressive), 10. Type c, 11. Fast charge, 12. Ui.Cons-1. Heavy weight, 2. Quiet thicker, 3. Processor (heating issue, sometimes heats up without any reason maybe because of background process), 4. Ui lags, could be more optimized, 5. Display (samsung could have given atleast ips panel), 6. Charger(15w charger is not sufficient for a 6000mah battery) 7. Because of ui and processor the battery service becomes very bad which could be good although.
"
109,"  I am Samsung user for longest time and despite some negetive reviews, I say best value for money. Only downside are its heavy, but you get use to it and the screen quality. Yes, side by side my other Samsung its a let down, but of its own it's absolutely fine. So, if high quality OLED is must for you then get the one of the other models.Rest no hang issues, does not heat, brilliant battery (as a backup phone on extreme power saver mode it lasted over 5 days!).
"
110,"  I got it delivered yesterday. So these are my first impressions after initial setupSize:This is a huge phone. So if you have small hands this phone cannot be used single handed. If you need to use it single handed often, better go for a grippy case with a string or a ring case so it doesn't fall out. Or go for a small phoneSpeed:It is a bit slow, but you can get used to it. For the price range, it seems to have a decent performance.Audio:This phone is advertised as supporting Dolby Atmos but that's only for bluetooth or other audio devices. Not for the phone speaker. Which is kind of a shame. But the audio is not bad.Video/Screen:Blacks are not exactly black. But again, for this price you shouldn't notice those things.Colors are bright***The phone is country locked. So to activate any other country sim you must first use an Indian sim for 5 mins cumulatively.I have not tested the other features like camera, fingerprint sensor etc. Will update as soon as I do
"
111,"  This phone comes with a ton of garbage Apps pre Installed. Samsung appears to be partner with IronSource which is a mobile app advertising company and they will keep bugging you to install tons of non sense apps. Over 10 apps were installed on my phone without my permission or without me asking or agreeing to anything. I did not expect this from Samsung phones, I know this is the case with most chinese phones such as Xiaomi but figures even Samsung comes with such Adwares. I wouldn't have bought this phone if I knew it was an Adware phone. You have been warned.
"
112,"  I was looking for a budget phone but didn't want to exceed 10k mark. And eventually I came across this model which was under discount. It was for 9499 and just ordered it right away. I don't have to tell you guya about samsung. The processor is more than capable of handling day to day task with ease. The best part is its battery. It lasts 2 days easily. And the camera is good enough to take photos and selfies. It's a win win. Thanks amazon for the sweet deal.
"
113,"  16/12/21Re-review, after one week of usage, ( learning the product better). I recall my review on12/12/21.Good value for money.  After learning the product and it's  features, I find my choice is worth.I have no idea how the picture quality is coming different & good to first few pictures.I am happy with my purchase.Thanks.__________12/12/21 - not the value for money - Samsung Galaxy M12 (Blue,6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)Review is based on first three days use.Reason for this purchase - switching from MotoXForce, due to irreplaceable exhausted battery & incresed ROM need.Rating for Amazon as market place - 4/5. (good display of available options, window shopping, product information, product comparison, communication)Rating for product - Samsung Galaxy M12 (Blue,6GB RAM, 128GB Storage):One star out of Five - Utter poor camera quality - 48MP quad cam image quality is damn inferior than my previous 24MP MotoXforce image. So unimaginable from Samsung. I find Galaxy S3 images are so fine quality.Battery charging not as fast, as the listing claims.Battery life (6000mAh) - not in tune with expectation, ehausts sooner.Fingerprint reader -  not always recognising. (perhaps the narrow finger print sensor limitation)This is disappointing.I encourage you go for a better option than M12.Thanks.
"
114,"  Good one. Serves the purpose. Good phone in budget. Powerful longlasting battery. A bit bulky and a bit slower (compared to higher mid range phones) considering 6GB RAM but you can turn off the animations (by activating developer mode) to make it faster. Still very few apps r a bit slower but that is quite acceptable as it doesn't irritate. Getting 6GB RAM for INR 11500 is awesome. It is not that slow also. Camera is good but shutter speed is slower. Hence, u need to be very steady while clicking pictures in low light else they turn out to be shaky. Nonetheless, a very descent camera in this range. Very difficult to get 6GB RAM Samsung in just 11500. Overall happy about this purchase. Good if u want a phone around 10K. Much better than simply spending 20-30K for few added features. Good if u want a secondary phone for office use (checking emails, etc.). Good for kids online classes. Sturdy enough. If u want non Chinese phone and r getting 6GB RAM in 11500 nothing like it. Just go for it. No regrets. Loving this phone.
"
115,"  Packaging - Bad (Though the item was fulfilled, Amazon?). After few days of usage; okay phone. New software.The battery does not feel like 6000mah; last 24-28 hours on low to just mid-level usage.A heating issue with 20 mins of YouTube watch and a notification is displayed that the device will be automatically turned off due to heating (while charging).The overall company wants to earn with this without much bothering about the value proposition.
"
116,"  ( I have the 6GB/128GB variant and this User Review is on this model ) If you are a NORMAL User like me....who does not play any Games or doesn't use the phone camera much......and just use it to phone call, binge some movies or TV Shows or listen to some quality music, then this phone is EXCELLENT for Usage. Go for the 6GB/128GB variant as some of the RAM and STORAGE is already occupied by the system. The display is good for viewing too... not too bad. PROS I FOUND AFTER MY USER EXPERIENCE:1) Android 11 out of the box, ONE UI CORE 3.1 is awesome and simplistic.2) It has DOLBY ATMOS for headphones which definitely gives a difference.3) The weight and thickness is AVERAGE and you won't even notice anything.4) Fingerprint Scanner is working well and good.5) Some of the Motion and Gestures settings are really cool and useful.6) The HIGHLIGHT of this phone is the Battery, and for me it lasted completely for 3 days straight on normal calls and some youtube.The charging time is worth it for the battery duration. This phone will get updates till android 13 or 14, which is great. The Exynos 850 8nm Processor is working well in terms of speed and smoothness. The 90Hz Refresh Rate is great and I felt the difference in smooth animations. A GREAT FULL ON PACKAGE FOR A NORMAL USER.

118,"  It's very bad that the sound in my phone is not working in just less than 1 month of purchase. We have warranty and Samsung may rectify the issue but who is responsible for the trouble we faced for two or three days. Samsung slowly going down and they can lose market share if they do not take an action on sellers who are selling defective pieces. 1 is the highest score that I can give but this phone is deserved for 0 or less.

"
120,"  This phone is not listed on Exchange models while buying a new phone which means Samsung has delisted its own product. That's how Junk this product is for Samsung. Amazon says exchange is listed by seller. We buy from Amazon and not Samsung. Add some more money and buy better products then electronic junks on Sale especially Mobile Phones.Sale period defective and faulty units are rolled out otherwise a new product cannot have problems within a month. There are only 2 buttons in a smart phone and that also most important one goes bad or was missing parts. You will waste money even in warranty - they charge pickup drop as travelling 10kms during covid and wasting half day in queue is a disaster.That's why Samsung sales suffer in Mobile phone markets------------------------------------------within 20 days the fingerprint scanner button stops working. initially looked good. it seems they are reselling used phones which can work until return window is closed. Amazon has zero liability post return window and they dumped junk
"
121,"  Overall the phone is good...huge screen size and battery life is superb! However, I have been facing issues with the performance of the phone. At times it runs slow, inspire of having just the basic apps installed. There are also instances where when I have to click the send button which in some apps is located on the top, it automatically takes me to another app!The only way to solve this issue then is by restarting the phone...and this happens on a daily basis. I have tried reformatting the phone to resolve the issue but it still remains. Also the colours of the photos arnt as dynamic as compared to the Samsung S10.

122,"  Its like a pure Samsung stock Android phoneEverything is customisable ,its easy to use no lags or glitchesGames run smoothly COD , Asphalt 9 etcCall Quality is goodThere is no wifi 6 feature ( not everyone has wifi 6 at home yet)Overall a great simple phone must buy!!!! Just Rs 10,000/-
"
123,"  In an affordable range this is a good phone to purchase. Loved the way it performes with its special features like 90hz display speed 6000mh battery and decent camera quality. If someone compares it with high budget phones and criticize then for them better to go expensive. Overall it's a great budget phone 📱..

126,"   Tik tik soung of plastic coming from charging jack/slot area..may be because of not sealing the phone properly or their is a gap inside. And sometimes my phone is fully charged and and charger is not attached then its showing at the bottom charged 92 % and remaining time of fully charge is showing 24 minutes.
"
127,"  I would say it's a decent mobile for the price.*Battery is outstanding*Display could have been better*Camera is decent and obviously can't expect more for the price.*90HZ really makes this phone special.*5g is not available, that's kinda disappointing.*The phone is also kinda heavy.Overall, a mediocre mobile phone for the price.
"
128,"  After having used an Mi A2 for about 2 years, this phone was a step down. The prices are similar, and both phones are 4G/64GB.Found this samsung phone thicker, heavier and slower. UI is a bit sluggish. Clear chat on whatsapp is almost always slow (it was very quick on Mi A2). Googlepay PIN keypad does not render properly (some numbers are cropped). A2 has dual speakers with better sound, and a qualcomm processor.The pros of M12 are : display is nicer, the battery is better, and the camera quality is better (don't like the auto play of videos in camera app, haven't found a way to turn it off yet).If I were to choose between the two, would go with Mi A2 (lighter, sleeker, faster, better sound).
"
129,"  Wonderful product. Power packed. Very handy. Easy to operate. Light weight. Value for mon ey. Excellent phone I have ever come across. Powerful battery lasting very long between recharges. I used it for whole day still battery dropped very little. Amazing. No heating  up of battery even after long continuous usage. Very sleek and thin design. Large RAM  and ROM. Delivery by Amazon was on time. Overall five stars without any hesitation.
"
130,"  Purchased mobile on 12th April 2021. IMEI number blocked on 20th April 2021. Enquired with Amazon they just simple told, replacement period over, not able to return the item.Again enquired with Samsung authorized service centre, they told it's a defective product, please discuss with amazon customer care, they only able to replace the item.If this product is purchased from Shop (offline) , maximum 14 days validity for replacement.Now need to change the mother board, it will take minimum 15 days. myself helpless from amazon. Please try to avoid the purchase from amazon.

131,"  No doubt it is a good smartphone but I was a MI user before and now facing some problem and some features are missing.here are my reviews on M12:Bettery backup is best ,camera quality normal but front camera is good. Screen size is very big for your pocket,Brightness is harmful for eyes in night eyeprotector is useless, you can add only 3  fingerprint for lock and sensor is wrost place at a very odd position, silence key is missing, 4 camera is a myths, 48mp camera also a myth,  for MI user: no magnitometer it means no compass for North South,  working.  When put earphone no icon show at above you can't know plugged in or not, power button doesn't off the flash light, 3 finger screenshot not working here, C-type charger so you have to take charger everywhere. OTG not supported,  heavy weight, Camera have very limited features like no timelaps video option, no grid view, no screen focus option.  It is a good phone if it will your first phone then it's OK but if you are MI user then in my opinion don't go for this .......
"
132,"  Much better than expectations and that too a brand like Samsung at this cost. Rest time will tell. But so far everything is just perfect. Was not aware that it had face recognition and finger print read. Though the phone is not that sleek and on the bulkier side, but I think that makes it even more durable and solid. And Rs. 1000/- off on ICICI credit card was icing on cake. Forget other brands. Need not say anything else. Totally impressed. Bought another one in black for my daughter and she too is in awe, even though she was using an IPhone 6 S. And it has been mentioned on the box, that it is manufactured in India. Another plus point. One can go for it with eyes closed, if budget is around Rs. 10k approx. If one is ok and satisfied with the features offered. Happy shopping.
"
133,"  If you ask me, the phone worth it if you are looking for 5G in Samsung brand. With a couple of great specks like Samsung's #FastestMonster equipped with the blazing fast Snapdragon 750G processor. It comes with a long lasting 5000 mAh battery and a versatile 48MP Quad camera for capturing stunning photos and videosCons: though Super AMOLED Infinity-U 6.6” display gives a true-to-life to mobile, indeterminately display clarity would not that great since it is just HD one. At last even I don’t like the in-screen security as it would not work as expected, that maybe I have not used to it since I am trying 1st time and I am blind person though.

137,"  Pros1. Big display phone2. Very good battery life3. Not heating on usage4. Good sound/audio5. For my usage,  good processing speed and good RAMCons1. Touch screen is not very accurate- I am having to click on a button multiple times to get it clicked2. Like, MI, Samsung has Samsung apps that though useless to me constantly keep running and updating and occupy memory and cannot be deleted3. Brightness control is not good - max brightness and min brightness have less difference4. Camera is ok
"
138,"  I bought Samsung to get less bloated OS but Samsung has gone shameless like it's peers MI and realme. OS is bloated and I hate the skin. I'm going to install a custom rom after a year.I bought it for my mom, she doesn't know how to protect her privacy and data and Samsung is exploiting it. Shame.I disabled these apps(in photo), I use micro g services instead of Google, but I can't disable some Samsung apps.
"
139,"  I'm writing this review after 1 month of use. here is what is faced in this 1month span.cons :1. Auto-restart sometimes without information.2. Messages app having every time.3. Battery is average.4.90 Hz refresh rates stuck your phone.5. Charging Takes 2 hours. the charger is 9w, not 15w.6. Video Quality compromised.7. No App lock inbuilt.8. Installing Google Apps takes a little bit of time.Pros:1. Good and stylish Design.2. smooth User InterFace3. Animations while calling are very descent.Last but not Least At this price This is the best I saw. I know it's so many complications but it's the best mobile at this price.Thanks.
"
140,"  It took me an hour to set up the phone as all the pre installed aps were updating one after the other, making the phone lag. After setup, I had to uninstall all the unnecessary app in order to ensure smooth running of the phone. Each time I try and install a low graphic game the phone starts lagging. The RAM is incapable to handle any low end gaming.  The phone is very bulky and the hands start to hurt if you're watching any video content. All in all, its not what I wanted it to be. Thumbs down!
"
141,"  This is by far the worst phone from Samsung. I upgraded from old Galaxy on7 pro to this one because it promised better OS, better screen refresh rate, better storage and better camera quality. But to my dismay, none of these is a wow factor in this phone except for battery life. The phone hangs every 5-10mins with only 2 apps running. The screen response rate is pathetic and camera quality below par, not sure what they mean by 48MP camera. Don't take this phone even if someone offers it to you for free. It's a headache more than a utility. I would urge Amazon to bring down such a pathetic product from their website because it will spoil their brand name as well.
"
142,"  I took this mobile for the battery performance.. and it was one of best phone i ever seen.. last month it was taking upto 2 days to drain the battery... then after one update.. it became worst it is taking only 20 hrs to drain complete battery.. and during night time also it is taking around 25 % battery. before update it was taking hardly 1 % battery in night times..worst part of the software it is not even showing which app takes more battery..With the latest update the battery and phone performance got very good..Camera is improved a lot..auto brightness setting is still take lots of time to settle.. sometimes it does not works need to adjust manually..Overall best phone with price point..
"
143,"  Got this phone for my dad who loves YouTube and watching news.Pros: Great battery life (need charging once in two days with moderate use), Supports fast charging, No Androidware thus very smooth UI and no lag, excellent 4 camera in rear and brilliant front facing camera, Runs on latest Android and processor is quite peppyCons: Slightly bigger in length and little heavy compared to others, Future Android upgrades not clear, Not 5G enabledTips: I got this phone under 9.5K so wait for the right deal.
"
144,"  Good phone for average daily use. I am slightly disappointed as wifi calling feature is missing. My old M30 had wifi calling two years ago. Also, the call volume is very low, I have to press against my ear to listen to calls.
"
145,"  Samsung Galaxy M12 features a 6.5-inch HD+ Infinity V display with 720x1600 pixel resolution. The smartphone display comes with a 90Hz refresh rate. Samsung Galaxy M12 is the only smartphone in this price range to come with this high refresh rate. Samsung Galaxy M12 comes with an adaptive refresh rate which means that the panel cannot be locked at a high refresh rate. The high refresh rate display functioned smoothly during scrolling through Facebook and Instagram. For some reason, the refresh rate on the Samsung Galaxy M12 is locked at 60Hz for the notification centre. Also, the 90Hz mode is turned off while using apps like YouTube. Despite the high refresh rate and HD+ resolution, the display on Samsung Galaxy M12 is not that sharp and vibrant. The brightness is also not great and you might face some struggle while using the smartphone under direct sunlight. The display is large enough for you to enjoy movies and also play games. The display also comes with an eye comfort shield which reduces the blue light from the screen and prevents eye strain. The display on the Samsung Galaxy M12 is decent but it is definitely not the selling point of the handset.
"
146,"  Simply you better to skip this phone I break my old screen so suddenly I need to buy I brought this because I get it in good price but after I receive I realized it's simple useless 🤣 my old 3gb ram phone (I brought in 2018) 100 times better than this it's easily struck most of time touch doesn't working screen just break because I sleep on it you can't play pubg in it no games you can't use much outside in summer or do work much it's easily shut down phone easily over heat many problems .. people who need phone for simple thing like calling watching YouTube better to buy this
"
147,"  - Processor is good and all the apps works perfectly, doesn't hangs, multiple apps could run without abruptly closing or need to close.- Best for people who don't want to make use of heavy apps like snapchat- Camera quality is okay not so good when compared to M21. But looking at the cost of the phone this feature is justified.- Supports normal and wifi video calling without any issues- Speaker sound is okay, same cost factor- Two features which I feel are thereal drawbacks.  Finger print sensor is from the  side power button which is just below the volume button so you need to press it very carefully else it asks for phone restarting or switching off.- Second is not a real major one but the phone is very heavy in weight.- Battery life is okay you may continuosly watch movie or videos or use phone for 6-8 hours, takes 2 hours for full charging. Phone gets heat up in 1-1.5 hours of continuous use.- Display is good- Face ID works better than finger print.- Call recording and voice calling are clear- Have port for ear phones.- Hotspot feature is okay because phone started heating up when I turned hotspot on.- No network issues with either of the nano SIM
"
148,"  To be honest i was totally skeptical whether i should buy this phone or not,  seeing so many negative comments, I took the risk and bought it..After using the phone aggressively for 2 days i must say as i read from the reviews that this phone Hangs on operation which is totally FALSE .Phone totally works fine. Having a refresh rate of 90Hz the phones doesn't show any delay, the UI is smooth battery is quite strong . Using aggressively at max only consumed 46% of battery in two days (discharged from 100% to 54%).The only thing that will disappoint you is its Camera Which works like a 6-8MP camera.Macro shots are not that detailed either.Front camera is just like having a 2-3 MP camera.Samsung should have uplifted camera quality when they mentioned it with 48MP camera.This phone will disappoint you in terms of camera quality.Rest the phone just works very well in terms of other configurations.
"
149,"  This phone is the best in this price range with best battery and camera performance. I would have more pleased if it had an amoled display . Surely Samsung had the ability to imply an amoled screen but they didn't . They could have used Snap dragon 600 series chipset instead of the exynos. But still this is the best phone under this budget. Better that A21s of Samsung . It's the best 10k budget phone now. Don't get confused with f12 it's just same as M12.
"
150,"  Awesome budget phone with all the features that is required for daily use like 6000 mah battery which last upto 1 day after internet serving, watching videos, listening music and lot more.Screen resolution and screen size is really well in this budget and you can't expect better than this within this budget.Processor is also good for normal and average use, its not made for playing heavy graphics game like PUBG, COD, Asphalt etc. You can go for it if you are looking for something with a decent spec and long lasting quality.I'm a samsung user, I am using samsung since last 9+ years and I can claim that samsung gives the best quality product amongst all the other brands except Apple.Camera perfomance is really well as per 48 mp. The only thing is its bit unstable in night time. You may require some extra light for taking pictures in night.
"
151,"  Too good too purchase.PROS:1. CAMERA fantastic camera. With 48 Mega Pixels. Low light pictures are better than any other Realme or redmi type Chinese mobile. Even it's good than OPPO.2. PROCESSOR Too good. Better than any other Mobile under Rs 10000.3. Screen : Don't read review of other people. You will never realize it's Oled or else. Screen is good.4. RAM. You will get pure 4GB free RAM with 4GB model. In Realme or Redme you will find  half RAM already full.5. Battery: Battery is too good. I used it full day after full charged. No need to connect to charger in the evening. Charged it next day when you feel free. Even it can play YouTube for half hour with only 2%  battery.6: FM : Fm recording available with good quality.CONS.1 If you play high grafic game for more than 1 hour than it will lag for 10 to 15 second.2 No screen recording. But you can download any application from Playstore or Samsung store.3 Not having magnetic sensor. That's why not good for traveller. It will not show you north direction. You will face difficulty to know the accurate direction of your target.Conclusion : Don't go for any other Mobile brand upto 11k. Go for this SAMSUNG mobile.  M12 or F12.
"
152,"  It is working as per the specifications. The phone is getting strucked in the middle of while continuously the application usage is getting struck for a second,I have to close the application once and again I have to open the particular application It is only drawback I faced in this mobile. Apart from that the sound quality picture quality and video quality all are good as per the cost provided for the mobile. As I purchased this mobile during the Amazon great Indian festival on 7th October. I purchased this mobile through online using card as offer applied and I purchased at 8500 change. It is affordable for normal mobile price  from Samsung brand. If u want to use for normal use it is good mobile. If u want to use for high level games and all it is not Okey.  So you can go for other mobile model as per your need.
"
153,"  Bought it under 10k (black colour) . Average performance overall. You will get charger 15w,charging cable(which is shortjn length) and user manual in the box.No case is provided in the box recommended to buy one with it. Body is made of plastic which is of low quality, black one looks decent compare to other colours.Pros:1.Battery life is awesome(2 day backup for me on moderate usage) .2.Display quality is great (better viewing angle)with good audio support.3. There is dedicated micro SD card slot available.4. Type c port.Cons:1. Phone is heavy and thick, you can feel the weight  when you are using it. But will get used it after few hours.2. Camera is below Average, not a camera centric phone.3. OS is laggy, you can feel it sometimes when you are using it. Samsung One UI is great but it makes it laggy.4. Can't do any heavy gaming, average game can be possible.5. Battery takes time to charge, but drains really slow. Lasted 2 days in full recharge. More than 2 hours to charge fully.Overall this phone is good for media consumption only.
"
154,"  The features offered by this device at the price range are fabulous. There is no lag during the usage. The display is good for watching youtube, netflix etc. The camera is decent w.r.t. the price at which you get it. For gaming, it is optimized for no lag.Perfect optimized performance at this price range. Call quality and speakers are good enough.
"
155,"  Everything is good in this phone camera is okay in daylight means if your facing the source of light your photo will be good but at night the photos are poor and there is no other problem but I was disappointed because the company says true 48MP camera and it has quad camera setup but the photos are not up to mark the photos of my redmi 9 prime which has 13MP QUAD Camera setup are excellent far better than m12
"
156,"  Excellent product, ensure you use non-chinese products because of the SAR values.The SAR values mentioned by chinese manufacturers are fake, they are far higher than what is mentioned.. It is always better to use from reputed brands because they follow min ethics.If anyone is facing sluggish UI.. do this--Enable developer options> look for animations> disable the animations.Your phone will work like superfast..
"
157,"  I got it for 8999 with bank discount, very good phone for the price. Battery is awesome,it lasts for 9 hour continuous video Play and 1.5 day nirmal use.15W charger charges fast.Fingerprint on side is fast and it's easy to unlock then phone on table. Other phones have fingerprint at back side which is useless.Camera quality isnt that good but it's okay.Only problem is Samsung installs unwanted apps without permission. It installed the paisabazaar app without my permission. The ""paisabazaar"" and ""policybazaar"" are the biggest scammers in India.
"
158,"  Camera quality is awesome, no compromise on the quality.Battery life is excellent, for my usage of approx 20 nos long call of 5 - 20 mins average, and corporate emails.... Usage the battery is lasting for almost 3 full days. Battery is seriously a Monster.Fingerprint reader is an average one... No comments!!!  Overall for the price of 10k (i got 2k discount from amazon and 1k for using icici card) this is an excellent product from Samsung. Also to mention the Android v11 is loaded... No compromise in security related flaws. Excellent phone... Go for it!!!!!

162,"  I bought this phone along with the similar priced Xiaomi Note variant and the difference is absolutely noticeable.The fingerprint does not work, at all!The wifi calling feature of the phone is worse than the actual mobile network (which is pathetic in itself)!WhatsApp will not work, all throughout the day.I suggest ya'll go with the usual competitors and ignore Samsung in the cheaper range, altogether!

163,"  A decent phone but not meant for heavy tasking..Screen is  decent..Samsung UI is working good.Sound is Decent ..Charging time is little bit Higher due to huge battery ( Approx 3 Hours for 0-100%)and charging wire is very small.Camera is good.Fingerprint Scanner is decent.Phone is little bit Heavy but its easy to handle.Phone is for  normal user not for gaming as sometime phone feels that exynos 850processor is not providing full power.

"
165,"  I had bought this phone for my father-in-law. He is pretty satisfied with the performance. Battery life is amazing for him (he does not use phone much, apart from occasional calling and receiving calls, and checking whatsapp twice daily), and he is getting 3-3.5 days of battery-life after one full charge.We know that we can get better phones from other brands in this range, but for elderly, the ease of use of Samsung OneUI is really a tipping factor for deciding on this phone.
"
166,"  This model has similar features as other Samsung mobiles. The camera quality is not that great but I don't mind I don't click much pictures anyway, it's not the best camera but it's not that bad. In this price range, I think this is the best deal I've got 6GB RAM, 128 internal memory, expandable up to 1TB with 6000mAH battery and I must say battery life is amazing.Since I trust the brand I always go for Samsung.
"
167,"  Unnecessary apps automatically download on their own. We can't control them. Any number of times you uninstall them, again, they will download and install without our role. There are no settings in phone to control them. Very nuisance.Screenshot is not working.  Overall working and performance is not up to mark even for this price level. Some other model from Samsung or other brands or honor are best alternatives.
"
168,"  Samsung refused to replace screen citing physical damage. As the entire phone is already covered under warranty for any factory defects, there was no need to mention 6 month free screen replacement separately. Had I known this, I would have taken an Insurance. This is clearly a very bad customer experience from a well known brand like samsung. In my eyes, it has already tranished the high brand image for samsung I had. I feel deeply cheated.
"
169,"  I don't have any games on my phone and no sm app apart from twitter. My phone usage about 98 % comprises of reading my mails and attachments i.e. pdf, doc, xls files etc. and voice calls. Overall my phone usage is less since I work from home mostly from my laptops. But the battery drain is visible within just 3 months of use. The use of mobile internet is also low and I usually work with wifi but the power drain is significant while using internet. I have checked if any app is draining battery but didn't find anything. All this claim of 6000 mah is disappointing. I will probably take my phone to the service centre soon.
"
170,"  Amazing blue colour,If you need battery backup phone and have extream use of phone stock market trader like me, go for it without second thought. Superb battery. 100% would last 1.5 or 2 days.Processor is not good enough to handle game. So it's not gaming phone.Screen refresh rate is quite good.I returned my third class POCO F1 in 8k by cashify and bought this one. I got good deal.Camera quality is not good enough.. you need to on 48mp always.
"
171,"  The phone is excellent. The call quality is good too. Everything is satisfactory or much better than expected.The major glitch, however, is non-operational USB tethering. It simply doesn’t work.So if you want a phone that needs to be taken to the service station the minute you switch it on, if you cannot live with a faulty phone or if you must have USB tethering, keep away from this Samsung.
"
172,"  Maine ye cell 17 ko order diya aur 19 ko mujhe recive hua. 3days use karne ke baad mera review-Phone ka Camera aur battery super hai, screen size bhi pocket friendly hai, battery backups almost 2days.Mujhe isme kuch basic kamiyan lagi jo is prise range me nahi hona chahiye, jaise aap net ka speed screen me nahi dekh sakte kyunki setting me option hi nahi hai, isme net bhi slow chal raha hai. Speed show nahi hone se pata hi nahi chalta ki problem cell me hai ya sim network me. Mere likhane cell me idea 4g ka speed achha tha leki. Isme nahi hai. Overall mujhe bahut jyada khushi nahi hui is cell se, jabki maine Samsung ka naam dekh kar m12 purchase kiya. Please Samsung dhyan de.
"
173,"  Samsung M12 is not worth it's price due to various shortcomings faced by me. (1) FINGER PRINT SCANNER DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY Position of FP scanner on right side (unlike backside of phone in Samsung A21s & other models) fails FP Scanning. And if mobile has a backcover if the one recommended by Amazon at order stage, then FP scanner will fail you. (2) FACE RECOGNITION ALSO DOESN'T WORK Most of the time Samsung M12 doesn't recognize my face. (Looks it doesn't like my face with which no problem on Samsung A21s). (3) CONTACT PHOTO IN RECENT CALLS FEATURE REMOVED Recent calls appear without Contact Photo. With Recent Call feature in other models it was easier to search & Call numbers from Recent Calls List. (4) STORAGE 4.94 GB of Internal Storage & 7.13 GB of SD Card being shown as Used by OTHER details of which no where. No way available to scan this storage usage & remove unnecessary OTHER consuming Internal & SD Card Storage. (5) NOTIFICATIONS NOT APPEARING ON LOCK SCREEN Despite trying my best Notifications from various apps do not appear on Lock Screen. All settings, including of Lock Screen tried without any success. Think before finalizing Samsung M12.
"
174,"  First, Samsung's reliability and second, I ordered this product by combining them with so much emotion that even if I don't want to understand, then I will return it because I will definitely be heard here and when I ordered it, I understood that I have got a very good product and I am very satisfied with it, I gifted it to my brother, he used it regularly, there is no problem of any kind, you guys must also take it
"
175,"  M12 is fulfilled my expectations completely, hats off to Samsung. Quality camera and fingerprint reader are best of this range. Especially big battery gives good support for online classes without interruption, totally we are well satisfied with product.
"
176,"  Good buy within the price  range, this thing is powerfull, the one's looking for performance this is the product, 6 gb ram with 128gb to access with is worthy. The system has variety  of settings to choose from, this might get slow when google drive is being used for contacts and other things as it directly fetches data from drive but there are other settings you can play with and enjoy games at a very good speed.. And the charger is powerful.Recommendation for games: try games from ppsspp emulator.
"
177,"  I am writing this review after 3 days of usage. I have upgraded to this phone from a Redmi 5A. Looks and feel are simply amazing. The usage experience is also superb. The battery life seems to be v v long, when compared to my last phone. Overall, I am very happy and satisfied with this purchase. Seems like a real upgrade from my old Redmi 5A... and, to top it all, Amazon gave me an exchange offer worth Rs. 2500 on my 3 year old Redmi 5A... I have nothing to complain.Last but not the least, the delivery experience was also superb... delivered within 2 days !!! And the delivery guy was also very helpful and patient as it took more than half an hour to reset my old phone before handing it over to him.Overall a 5 star experience... However, I would have loved to give a 6-star for battery life as well as the delivery experience.
"
178,"  Writing this after 4 months if heavy usagePros:-1. Very very big battery life. This battery is so big that you can easily use it for 2days with moderate use.2. Very beautiful screen even though it is LCD. Samsung has not used any cheap screen. You can enjoy your Movies and Web-Series.3. Very good camera ultra wide mode is just so beautiful you don't need panaroma mode in this. Selfie camera is just awesome .4. You even get headphone jack.5. The screen is pretty big best for online classes and binge watching.6. I have played games like BGMI, CODM, NFS with ease.My final opinion is that you should buy this phone if you want to do online classes, play games, or if you want a phone with big battery or if you are a binge watcher. You can download almost 70 movies with ease.

179,"  I am a student  .first time I thought  to purchased a smartphone  from.my first salary . I waited for Diwali to get offer price . I searched  all over the internet  to get a budget smartphone  ....but I don't want to compromise  with RAM, ROM ,Battery Mah and must Made in India.....At last I got to know about this smartphone....which gives 6 gb Ram, 128 gb internal storage,  and 6000mah.....I satisfied 100 percent.  I never expected  to get this at just 10000 only from Samsung .....
"
180,"  Samsung m12 gives smooth performance. Its 48 mp camera is good but the quality of image it captures is low quality.It has a long battery of 6000 mah. While charging phones heats up. But within a few minutes,it cools down.Overall it is a good phone in 11,000/-Update: 6 may 2021Now its one and half month is over and it has started to heat up  unecessary during charging.🙄Update : 4th July 2021The phone is not taking charging instead it is draining the battery. I does not expected this type of issue with #samsung.
"
181,"  This is really irritating that I ordered this phone as brand new and within few months now the power button is not working. When I took out to the service center they r saying it is open piece and blaminge that I have opened it. They need money to replace the cap inside the button. Never expected this from Amazon to give me a used piece or Samsung service center is playing a game for money.
"
182,"  What would you expect witha battery of the size 5000, that it should be great. Well it okay not that great.I think due to the size of the battery the phone feels quite heavy.Camera: let me say this bluntly that the camera is not great it okiesh time. Didn't expect this from the Samsung company.I know the prize is less but didn't expect the camera to be that bad.If you are going to buy it for battery performance then you may go for it.
"
183,"  My review after receiving mobile..Dont think that samsung phones are hang every time.. the thing is how you dealing with the phone is matters with any brand...Rear/ selfi Camera - awesome performance (daylight conditon) 4.5/5Battery - 4/5Display- 4/5And unexpected features comes within it in this price range bcz it comes with android 11 latest version...90hz refresh rate👍working good.Side fingureprint sensor - fastIt support dual volte network...Awesome productThank you samsung for this monster reloaded smart phone...Don't worry guys go for it...
"
184,"  A great device (on the heavy side) for general usage.Ordered for mom who uses WhatsApp, Facebook, YouTube. Battery lasts for at least 2 days easily.The camera quality is good enough for this price range and good to see the latest Android 11 onboard. 4 years of updates makes it worth the investment for long term usage.
"
185,"  Average phone considering price range.1. Camera quality: average, no slow motion or time lapse feature available, no zoom when using 48mp. Front camera, below average. Sometimes I take a photo that doesn't get stored, quite annoying.2. Weight: quite heavy, you feel the difference when you take some other phone in your hand.3. screen type: lcd not led or amoled4. Batter life: looks good with normal usage.5. Phone body: back panel looks like of plastic, it would have been better if matelic had been used.6: user interface: sometimes very hard to do something, like taking a screenshot. Could have been given some better option to do that. Also, I use night model, where it gets better into grayscale in night, I can't customize some options like what apps and what type of do not disturb I want, also if had turn it off in some urgent cases I have to go back into settings and then disable it. Not an easy option provided.Face recognition: not fast and accurate.
"
186,"  I was looking for solid battery backup phone.. and I found one. M12 is awesome in battery backup,  display is great. Finger print sensor is flawless..Overall a good second phone for my needs..This is going to be a great,Samsung budget phone..I had one incident too , I slipped the phone in a bucket full of water,  I took it out immediately and its working fine...
"
187,"  Overall 3star.. very bulky and a slightly heavier phone. Could work on the bulk and weight of the phone. After a few updates the phone slows down. Samsung needs to work on the performance of the phone. I have been using the phone for 2 months now (6gb ram 128gm rom) and I feel that the performance has slowed in just 2 months. At times there is lag and the phone screen stops responding completely. The pages get stuck and the screen touch also gets weird.Problem areas to sum up1) heavy 2) bulky 3) touch screen is not that great4) slowness of the phoneGood things1) battery life (as of now) 2) camera 3) finger print reader 4) ok phone for basic usage
"
188,"  The overall look of the phone is good.The features available at this pricing is excellentThe camera quailty is a bit disappointing specially the front camera.There are very few button option and many are missing which is available in the button menuLot of features are also missing in camera.Battery life is very very good listening to music watching movies and day long games .Overall a good phone at the given price rangeHappy to be a SAMSUNG mobile Fan
"
189,"  I purchased it for the 6GB+128GB combination. Though knowing that the processor capacity could be less. But it is indeed a surprise. 6 GB RAM effect is clearly visible apps launch too fast, scrolling too smooth.Have been using it only for 3 days .. but initial feedback is quite good.I should also mention Delivery - superb!. I ordered at night 11pm. next day 11am the phone was with me. Truly.. Kudos to Amazon team - suppliers, delivery and all combined. it is lightning fast.. and really nice.
"
190,"  Greetings, This mobile is a PREMIUM variant in budget/Basic smart phone.The main attraction is the exynos Processor (Samsung flag ship Brand) which offers Pristine call Quality and Great Reception.Who can buy it?A person who is looking for a reliable, Long run,Basic smartphone for what's app /Video calls and Working in remote areas where they get weak signals.Recommend for :Working professionals, Sr.Citizens and Kids(Online classes).Not Recommend for Gamers and who spend most of the day with mobile apps
"
191,"  Iam not a gaming user...so first of all this review is only for normal users...1.Very importantly  the battery stands so strong from its competitors.2.Display though lcd HD+, is so good from all viewing angles.3. I just love the side mounted fingerprint and power button but may be difficult  for some new smartphone users4.camera though  not great, at this price point it stands stronger than  its competitors with all four cameras5.colour variants of phone can be even more optional for users (as of now only three courses two usual colors and one slightly different colors.6.speaker is usual loud but not so great since it's competitors atleast gives surround speakers at this price point. But clarity of sound is great,but bass lovers wouldn't  love these speakers.7.Actually the expectation  and reality  of Samsung  exynos processor  changed my opinion  on their processor...it was great 👍...u will definitely  love it...8. One UI stands apart from all its competitors(especially mi ui ads on mi phones)It was my own experience and review with the phone...If iam wrong at any points peoples can comment me with correct ones so that users buy a better smartphone...Tq
"
192,"  Battery backup very good. Some features are very helpful, that is tap to wake up & screen off, eye comfort shield, dark mode, Dolby atmos. Transfer massages, contacts, settings, notes, app data are very easy from my old Samsung phone. Overall experience very good.
"
193,"  Good quality Samsung phone for general use (6gb ram/128gb). Android 11 out of the box, which is important for security and software compliance/updates for a londer time. Good camera. Excellent battery life (2.5- 3 days with non gaming, sparse content viewing). Better than cheap chinese wannabes in quality and comes with Samsung reliability amd latest Android 11, even though it may be nominally behind in a specification or two..
"
194,"  Product is not working properly got replaced but the issue is still presist and will not be rwolved in near future.I do not that how may buyer are receiving this issue bit I am getting that issue.In phonepe when I enter upi pin that keyboard number are cutting in half size.That is the issue and heating so on..Sound tones are changing automatically.Loud speaker is not working on call. No voice come out in laud speaker on call..:(
"
195,"  Got it in Big billion days offer ₹8500. In this price category the phone is good.Screen and battery are Good.Camera quality is below average.Lots of unwanted applications pre-installed. But you can uninstall some of it.There is no back cover and screen guard in the box.Phone feels little heavier.Its ok for minimal usage. Not for heavy mobile users.
"
196,"  Everything about this phone is good but there are some problems also like processor is bit slow so you will see a very small lag b/w input and output. Too much heavy and width is also too much and it definitely don't looks like 2021 model phone bcz of weight and width of phn specially when technology has so advanced that there are too slim and light weight phns available in the market; it took like phn is from 2015 something. Screen's performance is definitely not upto the mark.I'm a student and I  generally use laptop for much of my work and uses mobile very little, so can't give that much detailed review about everything but yeah I can say one thing that  if you are a student than it will definitely serve the purpose for which you will buy it.
"
197,"  My earlier m31s stopped working suddenly, and in order to have a backup during lockdown purchased this one. It is budget friendly if bought in sale. Same as other phones in size (which are being launched lately). speed and memory in sync. However, camera and finger print scanner a big turn off. Dont go for it if camera / pics are main purpose or you use that often.
"
198,"  Got it for 9.5kIt deserves 9k as other brands are selling same phones at such price.Battery backup is the primary reason for buying this.48 MP camera does not give good quality pics. Its just that they have faked by increasing the MP of camera without actually improving image quality.4 camera is useless. Anybody would use only one camera. So its better to give just one camera with good quality rather than to give 4 average cameras.
"
199,"  It's the worst phone I have ever seen. The build quality is really poor. And speakers of the would will give you a night mare. We can't hear the phone even if it's in your pockets . Speakers are toooo low. I would definitely not recommen this phone. Instead opt for mi or anyother brand where you would get tons of features at this price. I feel regret buying this phone.
"
200,"  After using this mobile for 2 months I would say its an ordinary mobile for adults who are average users.As i said its an average mobile, good call clarity and user interface.Overall mobile is quite slow (you wont feel like its 4G RAM) even the contact search will take few seconds.Camera is below average 48 mega pixel is not upto the mark (I have used 48 mega pixek redmi note 7 pro) video clarity is very bad, selfie camera is the worst.Macro lens is not clear.Irrespective of the apps you use it will be slow. I don't play games but for sure its not suitable for playing heavy games.Battery is good will come for more than 2.5 days with normal usage. Best for elders.Display is okay.Side mounted finger print sensor is cool.Price is quite high with the above drawbacks.
"
201,"  The phone has good battery better than most other phones.The performance is not upto the mark. Camera doesn’t look like 48 pixel.Writing 48 pixel camera, 6GB RAM and not experiencing such level of performance based on specs raises doubts on Samsung.Definitely compare with other phones in the before marking a purchase decision
"
202,"  Purchased Samsung Galaxy M12 mobile phone to replace an under preforming mobile. Have been using this phone for the last one month.It is lovely in appearance. Has decent storage capacity, quick data retrieval capability, good Battery life. Camera performance is commendable.I recommend Samsung Galaxy M12 mobile phone for those who are looking for a good mobile phone with decent performance.
"
203,"  First time i am faced the problem online purchase, after 10 Days mobile display nit working, the acko insurance party not collecting, he told go to service center and  repair it we can reimbursing the invoice amount, but when i am going to add bank details these is A difficulty in IFSC Code. Till today my mobile not ready and not possible to online Update,
"
204,"  - Phone becomes hot on using for 10 minutes- Poor battery performance, in around 8-10 minutes 1% of battery is consumed while browsing some app (no music or videos were played)- Phone is thick and heavy to hold and it brings pain in fingers and hand (this cannot be blamed as weight is already mentioned in case description)- Never expected such product from Samsung
"
205,"  Having trouble with network connection for mobile data access & hotspot also.User interface also not user-friendly. Heavy to handle for prolonged usege.Call recorder toggle switch also not found during call screen buttons.Not even gestures available for emergency torch light on & off. Only available in notification switch panel.Connection issue faced while browsing, YouTube thumbnail not showing, Facebook buffering to play video & scrolling got struck repeatedly and even browser app update also could not complete even after several attempts in playstore.Battery backup performance was also not satisfied even when 6000MAH capacity configuration with 6GB RAM / 128GB STORAGE available.Very embarrassing experience with this new Samsung Galaxy M12 after 3 years smooth usage with my present device(redmi y2).
"
206,"  Mobile have a decent look,For this money range we should not expect high,It will flexible to our parents for youth, you should think twice,Battery life was good, Fingerprint was perfect,Face unlock when light was sufficient it works good,In low light bit late but works.Main drawback was weight of mobile it was bit heavy.Front Camera have decent image in daylight, but we will observe Noise in Image.Something with back Camera.This review is purely my experience with M12 mobile.
"
207,"  After usage of 6 months, I'm satisfied with the smartphone. In this budget, this is possibly one of the best offerings. In the world of Android,nowadays Samsung possibly has the best offerings in every price range.Camera is OK enough. At least OK for a 10k phone.Sound quality is loud and clear, with display of good quality. Ganes and consumption of multimedia is enjoyable.Interface is clean and multitasking is smooth. Charging is fast enough. Obviously, the best part is it's massive battery and power usage. With moderate use, it can easily go past 2 days and that is a big plus for people always on the go.In the 10-11k category, this is possibly the best I've used so far. This is a phone for ages to keep.Thanks to Amazon, delivery was in perfect condition.P.S. Before buying, even I was skeptical reading some of the negative reviews. I'm a common user, and my understanding is if you're expecting top of the line performance from a budget phone, then your expectations are to be blamed. Or most of the bad reviews are sponsored ones.If you want top of the line, you gotta spend top of the line.This phone gets the BASICS right, and that is what matters in the long run. And no phone in this category will offer a truly top class camera; even if they do,they will compromise in some other areas. Whereas, M12 with its 8nm efficient structure along with a Trusted Chip Set gets the job done in a smooth manner. Overall, if you want Smooth operations with Reliability, trust Samsung M12.
"
208,"  Battery life is so good  and camera quality  is average  like 13 mp. Front camera is like 2 mp. Fingerprint reader working without touch finger. When we hold in hand then finger  print reader trust to read any part of hand so it was problem. Processing system is very low. And in this mobile internet speed very slow. And in low network  it's  internet  not worked. Only show processing.
"
209,"  It's budget phn with all facilities plus Samsung brand... It's a good choice... You can buy it without doubt if you want a good battery life,  good picture quality,  good camera, also its not lagging in game, good processor and ram with no overheating issue... In this budget it's the best budget and pocket friendly phone. You can't expect more in this budget
"
210,"  i bought this phone from amazon with in 6 months of my purchase , one day it just got heated up in my hand and went blank i went to samsung auth repairs and i was told that its mother board has corrupted and needs to get changed but it is not covered in warranty then what the warrenty is for they asked 9000 to repair it so i have no choice but leave it that way lost 110000 rs will never buy samsung product ever
"
211,"  The phone works rather smoothly has a decent battery life where it lasts the entire day with the charge being at 47% by midnight. The camera performs well for the price, except the camera quality in the dark is grainy, and could be better. There is a weight to it which adds to the build of the phone. There is one speaker grill on the right side of the phone and has excellent audio. Would recommend 10/10
"
212,"  Except a single band Wifi rest all is fine. I see the product description doesn't say much about its wifi band support. It should have said that it supports only 2.4ghz band.I have no complaints about the others stuffs except that samsung should not bloat the software bundle with so many non essential packages that I can't uninstall.
"
213,"  Dear all. I am writing this review very honestly, may other user get benefitted from this.I used this for 3 weeks and I would say it is clearly waste of your hard earn money .Pro.  Only batteryCons. 1.Heavy  and bulky2. Not adjustable in single hand for selfie4. Camera front. Worst quality all time grainy pic, no beautification5. Back camera also produce worst quality6. Processor is not much for heavy user7. Many time screen lag and hangDear it would be batter you purchase resume, dalne or opportunity in this price segment.If you use zoom app then go for snapdragon process over 700 it will be you option of virtual background in mobile . Media tek processor will not do much.I wnna to back this phone but window close by amazon and I purchased it's glass and guard and covers. So no option left. Pl don't buy this phone. Samsung create waste product in camera  In. This phone.
"
214,"  I am big samsung fan but nowadays samsung making the phones which are not capable for compete with other phones in this price range and mid range. WIFI 5 is not here , they can give only amoled screen , nowadays amoled is normal. Camera is not good but it's ok for this price range. Only battery life is good. Giving preloaded apps which are uninstallable. Buy in your own choice if you can add 1-1.5k more then go for other company phones coz nowadays these samsung phones getting hang problem  6 months later, I had m20 which had the same problem
"
215,"  Fingerprint reader is really good and quickBattery life is good tooCamera quality is decent, since I m not much into photography I am goodProcessor isn't powerful enough to run heavy games , but it don't play heavy games, so this mobile is perfect for meAbsence of secure folder is kinda heartbreaking but nothing that we can't manage
"
216,"  Had a mix up Galaxy M21 with M12 . Both comes next to next when you search for M21 . The price of the 6 GB varient of m12 and 4 GB of m21 is also the same . Only problem is M21 is Super amoled , Full HD with latest processor .  No comparison with both . Realized this only on unboxing when the screen looked very ordinary on running the phone .The lag to move from one function to the next is glaring ( even when it is brand new ). Reported this to amazon . They could not help as the seller support page is just a computer generated one which just runs you in circles . Basically no way to contact seller. Only a postal address - in todays world how is it even going to work?  Tried seller website .No reply . I was more than willing to Pay more since it was partly my mistake . Feel cheated with price of a decent phone which starts off slower than my 4 yr old current phone . If only the seller could help .
"
217,"  Samsung Galaxy M12 can be a good choice for customers who are looking for a Samsung smartphone under Rs 15,000. The smartphone offers a quad-rear camera, HD+ display and is backed by a 6000mAh battery which can easily last for two days. Camera quality is real good.  Fingerprint scanner is fast and responsive sound quality is betterHowever the phone is on the heavier side ,Does not comes with the clear case and headphones and you might want to add a good screen guard and case .Thank you
"
218,"  Been using this device as a secondary phone for my office purpose. Camera is not good, comes with bloatware every time there is an security update the bloatware apps are reinstalled again, have to delete them again and again.Performance is disappointing, the phone is slow.Display is Ok but there is a noticeable light leak from below panel visible on screen.Device is very heavy, thick and long in length making it hard to use with single hand.I am using it as secondary device, I only use for office apps like MS Teams, Outlook with office admin portal app which gives my company complete root access to device so I am using it only for office communication purpose and I am glad it’s not my primary device.Save your money go for other device not this one. I would not even recommend this to gift to elderly as this is heavy thick and slow phone.
"
219,"  Fingerprint sensor often doesn't respond. Without any reason phone goes in deep sleep mode and go for 3-5 cycle of restarting automatically then start working. Updates are available but not getting installed properly.Called service centers several times but no response received. It appears a faulty product.Camera appears good but if you compare the quality of pic with other models of Samsung it's quality is very average.
"
220,"  👂Do not waist your money on this mobile..👍Mobile is good as secondary usage, non slippery surface is the only good thing.👍You can change video quality in apps like u-tube, Amazon prime etc.👎Worst display👎Camera, display and touch quality not good👎Heavy weight 220gmNote✍️Go for another mobile with latest configuration.
"
221,"  Used for about a month.Battery: and fast charge is good to have. Battery really lasts. But phone is very heavy due to that. Lenth of phone is long too so has a chance to fall if the pocket isn't deep enough.Takes a good 2:30 hours to charge.Key pad is sensitive and great.Touch lock/fingerprint senser isn't upto the mark. I have used honor 7x and their sensor is far better.Screen size is impressive.Camera is good.
"
222,"  This phone does it job, but don't fall for 90Hz,It's gimmick, higher refreshing screen are only good if phone works smooth. This Amazon app don't even work properly, while scrolling these apps stutter,And junk! It automatically downloads unnecessary apps and makes phone even slower.Please go by other smart phone in this range.And if you are reading this review in 2021, please never consider phones below 20k for this brand. Go but mi, moto, realme, OPPO, vivo, you will get what you want.
"
223,"  This mobile has got excellent battery backup it's a beast.The display is also best 👍.The camera is ok-ok quality i.e Average quality as if u zoom a little the pixel decreases.The face regonization is very bad it doesn't work at all, you have to move ur face to 1-2 cm distance from Phone than only it works.No complain regarding fingerprint, it's works smoothly 😌.The sound through the speakers are quality sounds 👌.Overall except the face regonization this mobile is perfect👍.I gifted this mobile to my maa and she is happy with it 😊. Mobile at cost of  only ₹9999 is perfect for me 👌.
"
224,"  I have used this for a week now.So here is the detailed reviewPros1. Good battery life3. Fast processing4. Nice sound5. Good fingerprint  scannersCons :1. Average display(video quality sucks)2. Big on hand3. Screen is very soft it will break in a 2-3 fall4.Average camera.Go for m21 2021 edition for better camera.M12 quad can camera is if no use
"
225,"  Good Phone in this price segment and overall decent performance but camera is not really good as samsung showcase its true 48 megapixel ,even front camera quality not so good.Battery wise thumbs up!Charging time about 2- 2:30 hrs. 0-100, it will give you 1 day battery backup even after heavy usage.Dual 4G volte with dual standby.Screen quality preety good.It an heavy phone.For business purpose I recommend this phone.Overall 8/10.

228,"   Dear Amazon Customer service,Am Shailendra an Prime member of Amazon.I purchased an Samsung Mobile phone M12 from Amazon portal.but received an faulty phone,where unable to hear voice in calls.requested Amazon to replace.they called me and undergoes an test of Mobile,finds the fault and ordered replacement on 9th of this month.Till none of technician/ delivery/ pickup agent cane to me to replace.Am herewith attaching screenshot for your reference.Requesting Amazon Technical/ customer service team to sort out my issue at earliest.
"
229,"  The honest review could have been 2.5* considering, performance & camera quality, yet I'm giving it 5* because : when i was about to buy this phone i was on a budget and this was the best option for me, a 6/128 model of a top brand at 13500RS was a good deal and my top priority always was battery back and this amused me with its battery back up. If you are looking for a phone with strong battery back up with limited budget? Go for it... Otherwise you'll disappointed.
"
230,"  For my use case, a single charge lasts me around 6 days (charge 100% to 40%, after which I recharge again). Actually it should last me more than 10 days I think, if I allow it to drop to 1% before recharging. My use case is: office related video calls, email, WhatsApp, online shopping, connecting to chrome cast and watching YouTube videos on tv, sms, phone calls, reading kindle books, etc. Screen ON time, about an hour or so a day depending on video call duration. I do not play games on my phone. I keep it on battery saving mode, and 60hz screen refresh.Been using the phone for more than a month now. Very satisfied with the performance. Only slight issue was the slightly heavier weight of the phone compared to my previous phone. But I have gotten used to it and it does not bother me at all now.Regarding the screen being non fullHD, I thought it would be something I would notice. Nope, I feel no difference when reading books on kindle. Maybe teenagers with better eyesight will notice, but I definitely cannot.In summary, I’m very happy with the purchase. I just hope Samsung keeps pushing the updates till at least android 13, and security updates for at least 4 years. That would be perfect.

It will lasts upto 2 days if you are doing simple tasks on it.Processor is good.But one thing here is to mention that, if you are looking for good camera quality phone this is not it. Its front camera is not good. Picture quality ruining when you zoom in. So Overall good phone 🖖 except camera 📷
"
234,"  First of the phone was a worth purchaseand best budget promise by samsung.For a normal user epecially for middle aged one's and new android experiencing one's it is a better choise, why because of the branded non chinese mobile.Perfomance :1.Camera quality : primary camera is best and give awesome clicks but not impressed in secondary, but i repeat its a budget based handset by samsung..2.Finger print reader: take a few seconds some times, but in a wide range it is fast.3.Battery life : its awesome no word to say...And fast charging 15wA negative portion is weight, its weight is about 221 gm it's heavier i noted this here because, samsung introduced m21 model with more specifications and perfomance carrying the same monster typical battery 6000 mah but weighing only around188gm is very lite weight and easy to handle (remember the prize difference).Overall my conclusion is the product is worth for money. I am completely satisfied, why because i had that much money....So no over expectations, thank you samsung.And especially thankyou Amazon for best service again.
"
235,"  I bought this phone to last 5years(thus OPPO or Vivo was not an option).........my first phone was Samsung metro.......now it's Samsung galaxy m12..........user interface is good.......the phone barely looses any charge when idle or used via wired earphones..........satisfied till now
"
236,"  Giving 3 stars because1 - It only have got 2.4 ghz wifi card, 5 ghz wifi will not work on this. So if you have modern day fiber internet wifi, chances are it won't probably be compatible with this device.2 - It says 48MP camara but it is not the best camara regarding the specs. I don't understand why it got 4 camaras when other 3 are barley average in terms of quality.If you can have few extra thousands, then go with m30s series.I understand Samsung has to do stuff to do cost cutting and marketing, I also own a m31, that one is better. Also random apps will download from samsung app store until you dont force stop samsung app store.

242,"  What benefit we will get if I have 6gb or 8gb ram. How come this mobile will not provide dual band wifi, means I am getting low Internet speed with that single band wifi feature. Very much disappointed with this big drawback. Even lower price mobiles are giving this feature but not m12. Samsung smartly avoided by not mentioning this in the product description.
"
243,"  Seems like Im using 10 years back mobile. Its super heavy. Resolution is no good and I have eye pain. Camera is very bad. Yes they have given 6000 mah battery but it takes more than 2 hours to charge fully. And battery does not work like a 6k mah battery.Does not expect this from Samsung as they have huge market nowadays compare to Apple worldwide.
"
244,"  The phone is great. Good display and UI. Comes with 6000 maH huge battery. Charging is quick but 1 thing that comes as negative is the camera. The camera doesn't seem like 48 MP. It struggles in low light & the Front camera also suffers the same problem. You can certainly go for it if you are OK with below standard camera. Amazon delivery was excellent

246,"                
"
247,"   It is best at this cost from a brand like samsung. Display resolution is HD but it's 90 Hz. Battery life is awesome lasts 2 days. Camera is disappointing though. There isn't any gcam available yet. No silicon case in box. One UI is the best UI I have ever used yet. Fast updates. 15 Watt charger included takes almost 2 hrs for full charge which lasts for almost 2 days
"
248,"  As far as my opinion is concerned, the over all features are Ok. The drawback features are:1. M12 is out of Super Amolrd Screen.2. Back Fingerprint is more covenient than side3. Camera quality is not so hifi than other models4. S Bike mode should given, which will be helpful ehile driving..5. Charger model is different  than other M series Mobiles with battery of 6000 mah.
"
249,"  Purchased in June.What I like-Battery power. I charge it only once in 2 days. Being a medium-to- heavy user  it's a big thumbs up.- Storage capacity- Navigation speed- Not made in ChinaWhat I dislike- It's quite heavy!- Eyes hurt within 3 hours. It never happened with any of the phones I have  used so far (more than 10 phones ) . Some of them were really cheap too. I  don't know why this phone makes the eyes hurt. I am not a particular fan of  Eye Comfort Shield feature so this is a big minus point for me.- Camera here truly is just an accessory. Well, anyway, I didn't buy this phone  for cameras, my expectations were already low but the quality of pics are  even lower than what I expected.- Screen resolution.If you have other phones and want a budget secondary phone not made in China this one is good enough. I was sceptical about the performance of an Exynos processor , never used one before, but it seems alright so far.
"
250,"  I baught this phone but after 2-3days use i fill like its Display having some flickering issue then I Raised a Complaint. Then a Technician visited my phone and told me everything is fine. Them after 4-5 days later I again Feel Like Choppy And lagging problm and The Flickering issue. Then I called customer service they told me its out of replacement Policy. But when I insisted them they agreed to replace It. Now I am satisfied With the phone.Phone is smooth ( Just go in developer options and Set the animation scale to 0.5x Them Everything will be smooth)Battery is Monstar (6000MAH)Display have TFT panel But Samsung is Alasy winner in display department.Te display shows Deep Black not as Samoled panel but Better then (MI,Realme,oppo,vivo)Phone is Heavy but manageable.Cameras Are Decent enough For te Price range.I bought it for 8550/-I am happy 😊 with the device now.Now lets see What happen.I am writing the review After 15 days.Please check tw device Before buying.Thank You.

251,"  Got this phone @7749 after Exchange & bank discount at this rate no branded mobile may not come with Android 11..., so far is good still needs to check in all respects but all basic functions are working fine.

"
253,"  I expected a lot about samsung mobiles in this price segment, but after buying it I totally regret myself.. But as a reviewer, I would like to post the pros and cons that I observed in this mobile..Pros:-1. Long Battery Life.2. Advanced features which are only available in Samsung ecosystem (like ""do not disturb while in driving"" etc.,)3. Can fastly unlock the phone using Fingerprint scanner.Cons:-1. Total Weight of Mobile.2. Camera quality is not seems like a 48MP Cam.3. Display quality is also not good.4. Face unlock is just an useless feature in this mobile.5. Last but not least, the worst thing is the processor. A walking turtle would be better than the performance speed of this processor..If anybody like to buy a mobile in this price range, just go with either Redmi or Realme.. Those brands will really satisfy you a lot (I were a Redmi user and I fully satisfied with the features, that's why I recommended this brand). 👍
"
254,"  I liked the phone battery last long even I tool 6GB ram version but the phone is little sluggish in performance may be the chipset is not great in performing daily task. But one UI is great even 120 he refresh rate I found phone performance not upto my expectations while comparing to my old redmi phone but I liked that unnecessary apps are not getting installed like redmi. Camera is great and battery life is awesome.
"
255,"  (Review it after using for a month)It's battery backup is quite impressive, camera is good but could be more simpler interface, I am not a gaming person but as per my Experience it's working smooth, but yes sometimes for a sec you will it might be slow but overall it's a worth Price product as of now.
"
256,"  It was very happy when I received it that I haven't spent money on China mobile but within 10 day I started regretting as it has started to hang very frequently and that's annoying. I haven't added extra memory card and using phone with only one SIM. Return policy was 7 days and it started hanging from 9th day :(
"
257,"  Such an awesome phone ruined by a biggest lack of a most important and basic feature, GREAT battery life, camera, UI, lives up to its reputation;Great specs all round, only thing to be vary of is that it DOES NOT SUPPORT 5GHz band wifi “5G wifi”When you buy a phone with such great specs, it’s a real shame that the only thing slowing it down is a lack of fast internet speeds due to hardware limitation. Not having support for 5GHz in 2021 is 🤮🤮
"
258,"  For this price - Nothing great to be expected.It's a low end phone. So everything about this phone is below average - except battery.Bad ambient light sensor, decent camera, decent amount output, cheap charging cables - bad quality.Excellent battery!Expensive phones - outstanding performanceCheap phones - you get what you pay for

260,"  Positive point :-1) battery life is massive 🤟2) fingerprint reader is so fast3) best in this price segment4) non scratch poly Carbonated back5)latest Android6) real 48 pixel camera7) Samsung Knox security which is best ever safety from malware virus.Negative point1)if you like camera phone, don't go for it bcoz it doesn't click selfies like oppo,vivo,etc. 😂. It gives real pixel picture.2)a bit heavy phone.Overall this phone is awesome in this segment apart from selfies and heavy weight.Go for it if you need Massive battery back up , a real 48 MP camera.
"
261,"  Overall phone is ok. I have 6GB and 128 GB variant.Some advantages are there.1. In this Price getting good phone.2. Till now no heat or not hang.3. Till now Battery backup is good.4.  Video quality is also good.5. Good processor.Some drawback is there.1. Data cable is so small.2.  When charging no notification light is showing. When charge is full you have to check manually.3. Camera is not to the up yo mark like true 48MP.4. No notification light is there for missed call or anything.5. No Return policy is there.
"
262,"  I am using this phone from past 3 months and I never played any heavy games in this phone. I use it to attend calls and social media, watching videos,  listening music and for clicking pictures.I'm using Vodafone and jio Sim & I'm facing issue with Vodafone signal, whenever I'll get call it use to disconnect in-between.Camera performance is not bad, but I'm not happy with battery performance.  It has a 6000mAh battery but I have to charge my phone everyday it consume lot of battery.And phone is little heavy you have to buy additional cover and screen protector.Only charger and type c cable is available along

264,"  I am writing this review after using the device for 10 days.It is very good mobile in this price range. The battery life is awesome, lasts for 3 days once full charged with normal usage. The speed is also good, works well for daily usage. The camera is not the best does not feel like 48 MP. The 6.5"" display is very impressive. Gives amazing video and audio quality.Overall I liked this one and highly recommend to buy it.
"
265,"  I have been using Samsung M21, also my 2 family members using same model.So thought to buy this M12 for my father.1. Biggest disappointment DisplayLooks like a old age mobile2. Camera is ok ok3. Only good thing is battery 🔋.4. Cheap plastic body5. Heavyweight6. Go for Samsung M21 it's more better.
"
266,"  Camera quality is very poor and display quality too. This model is not listed in the exchange models list also. How funny that Amazon sold a mobile and they aren't considering the same model for exchange what kind of business ethics is this where as the same model is listed on Flipakrt for exchange models.
"
267,"  - My contact book is not too large, around 700 contacts, yet it takes a couple of seconds to load it. It didn't happen in my previous mobiles even though they were less powerful than this device.- Although it has 4 cameras at the back, the portrait mode is completely nonsense. My previous phone had only 2 cameras on back yet it's portrait mode was a thousand times better.- Fingerprint sensor is on the power button and a real pain to use when you have a mobile cover.
"
268,"  I am writing this review after the usage of 25 days. It is one of the worst phones Samsung has made with multiple issues.  charging speed is very much disappointed , taking lot of time to charge up. The main issue I am facing is that the phone battery  is slow charging and quick battery draining.. Phone heats up while charging as well as in normal usage conditions. While charging the phone heats up to an extent that one may feel that it could blast. 😡😡
"
269,"  Decent phone at 9,000 (after bank offers). The processor and display are not upto the standard. But given that this phone has knox security, I have little to complain about. This phone is strictly for old people who just needs a secure phone for day to day usage like messaging, calling, etc. Not recommended for any user who wants to do a lot of multitasking or gaming.
"
270,"  I buy this phone on Diwali offer for Rs9500 on 30 Oct 2021.For this price the phone is worthy enough..Now it been nearly 20days of usage..Pros..1.Best Battery life even in heavy usage it hold for a day its amazing...2.Rear Camera Shows the real face and color tone without additional filters in that way I love it..3.Display more than enough..90Hz Awesome4.Fastest FingerPrint Reader in this segmentCons...1.Front Camera not too bad as well as not good too..average for selfie lovers..but for me I like this one...Note it Mainly👇👇2.Processor or something make the phone lag...lag in popup the keyboard itself is not good....if it is a bug need fix immediately..3.Asking Updates for all the apps... may be it because of the phone launch day it was March 2021..I'm a Samsung fan So for me it is a better option for this rate..if you love Samsung buy it without the second thought...Apart all of the above the best phone for daily moderate users...OK for heavy usage(For Hours)...
"
271,"  I bought this for my mother. I ll just list what I don't like.1. Too heavy. Don't buy this for old people2. Camera is shaky and output is not great. I don't know why they have given four cameras.3. Too much of useless Samsung apps and galaxy items interrupting in between. I cannot able to disable these.
"
272,"  Samsung is cheating people with marketing big numbers for a product. All the specifications are just on paper.In reality, every specification is just sub-par.Camera quality is same as what you see in phones that released in 2012-2013, like Galaxy Grand 2.Battery is advertised as 6000mAh, but in actual, it gives the same result as a 3000mAh battery.Processor is just utter crap.Seeing a phone for the first where the initial setup itself lags like anything.Display quality feels same as resistive touch era phones.Screen shows bleeding symptoms.I wish they had a return policy instead of replacement.
"
273,"  This hand phone is perfect for those who want it for day to day use with decent gaming experience also security wise it is good one, actually before purchasing this phone i had watched so many videos in YouTube and amzon, After using it for some days I think it is very good for an average person but if you want to compare this phone with some other devices i think that you should avoid to buy this mobile phone also, if you have been using some high end devices for some times then also you should think before purchasing this phone. In my personal opinion i think this is very good phone with excellent camera and battery life, also performance wise it is good for day to day use. Itne kam daam mai Samsung ka bharosa aur NonChinese device wo bhi made in India. So go for it I'm sure this phone will not disappoint you.
"
274,"  Device is Heavy.Camera Quality is very poor.Screen Quality is very poor compare to othwr device in market.Fast charging is OkBattery backup is also Ok.I would recommend try other device in the same segment Like Redmi, Mi, Poco.
"
275,"  I had a lot of doubts before purchase on seeing the negative reviews lying here and there but my experience with the Samsung m12 was really exciting. It has good battery backup, the display, even though 720p is not bad to look at, screen brightness is optimum. RAM management is good for day to day apps. Haven't found any lags.  Haven't tried playing any games on it. The battery last for 2 days on normal usage and 1 day on heavy usage and takes about 3hrs to fully charge.  Over all it is a great phone. The true monster. Update: After using it for nearly 6 months I'm facing proximity sensor issue, which I found is common in midrange samsung devices because of which I'm planning to change the phone and never am I going for another Samsung device. There are minor stutters here and there even while using light apps like YouTube. The battery life is still awesome.
"
276,"  Hey so this is an honest review from my side. I thought Samsung phone would be great for my dad but it isn't so great. The battery life isn't good. Once the battery goes below 50% it drains really fast. Talking about camera quality, it isn't as good as expected. The pictures look grainy.. finger print reader doesn't accepts your finger sometimes, and if you put a cover on your phone then its even harder to use the finger print reader. This phone has good features but ya if I talk about the price it was good for 11k but not perfect!
"
277,"  Pros:Great Battery Life. Upto 2 days minimum.Great Camera.Superior smoothness in usability4GB RAM for multitasking.Built and feel of the phone.I use the phone primarily for clicking product photos for my website, and business calls. On a personal level, a powerful battery and camera saves me time and gives me a hassle free experience.  I use all sorts of video and image editing apps that requires a lot of ram usage and the phone has never crashed so far. Also does well for gaming. Hard core gaming may be sluggish. But for the price perspective, this phone is all you ever need.Cons:Face Detection  for unlocking — takes atleast 3 seconds to react. The fingerprint sensor is comparatively faster. But both is a little annoying at times.
"
278,"  Please do not buy this phone because Samsung Galaxy M12 phone generating too much heat with this I can not operate the phone in normal condition. I kept the order in return and the authorized technician came and he decided, the is phone working normal but the compliant was too much heat generates when it's in the handset, in this case, how I could not take calls and operate the mobile. there is no return policy and only replacement but that also not happened. I was very much disappointed with amazon's service and I lost 13499/- and my requirement not fulfilled.
"
279,"  Very heavy phone. Peculiar problem of Samsung phone always in hung state .if you want to use in outdoor in day time you can't see anything bon screen.  For screen shot you need to put an extra floating menu on screen which is very irritating. No compass app you can run on phone as it lacks the sensors. Friends don't buy it, Chinese phones are far far better than this. I also purchased it just to avoid Chinese phone and now I repaint it. Since sep 21 I am using it and this is worst phone I have ever had.

"
282,"  While Samsung boasts about the 48MP camera, the picture quality is not up to the mark. I was looking for a smartphone for my mother with a price range of 9-11 k and was confused between Resmi 9 series and Samsung M12. I finally decided to go for samsung since it has a good resale value. The battery life is just amazing, since my mom uses the phone for basic functions like calls, watching videos on youtube and social media, the battery lasts easily for 3 days on a full charge
"
283,"  Not up to the mark too many cons1)phone ram management is not good it hangs too much 90hz screen is only for show whenever u set screen at 90hz its start hamging2) VGA camera is better than this 48megapixal camera3)when i start mobile and setup it hang and restart more than 2 time so i will suggest  dongo for this phone
"
284,"  Fingerprint reader ,battery life and camera are 👍good as compare to others within this budget. My decision was very clear before purchasing that I would buy only phone within ₹13000 so I purchased and in my opinion  if ones budget is same then go ahead don't thing and read negative  review
"
285,"  The fingerprint reader is placed at an ideal location and works without fail. The battery life is really good even though it takes a long time to charge so in all good. camera quality of the primary camera is good for everyday use. The design of the phone is such that it does not wobble and there are no protruding camera. The built quality feels solid. No fingerprint smudges.I have experienced some jitters but nothing to complain about. Calling over WiFi facility works very good and the earpiece quality is decent. No issues with proximity sensor. Though it lacks the bells and whistles of its competitors, it does well. There is nothing extraordinary to write about, but it is actually good as there are nothing extremely negative to write about. Buy it and it will work as its supposed to. Also trusting on Samsung brand name for data privacy.
"
286,"  Great budget smartphone from Samsung.Got a bit worried after reading all the negative reviews about the phone's display and camera but they didn't fail me or Samsung. Great battery life and display looks awesome. Camera is normal; neither extremely extraordinary nor disappointing. Overall camera is satisfactory at this price. RAM and Processor give very smooth performance. Don't get worry about the bullshit negative reviews (by people who want gold at the price of brass).  Go for it.
"
287,"  I have gone through many reviews for this phone. But, I've not seen anyone talking about sound quality. Maybe their handsets are working absolutely fine.. Maybe my particular handset is troublesome. Anyways, since I got the phone on my hand, I couldn't explore as much as I should but overall my experience with Samsung is not up to the mark. I purchased Samsung's phone hoping to get some amazing performance which the company and other reviewers (mainly YouTube reviewers) claim.I am not that technically sound person to digest every single term the phone companies (manufacturers) use these days. Still, I've gathered a little bit of knowledge and experience after using various smartphones over the long 11-12 years.I got this model (Galaxy M12) exchanged with Redmi 8A Dual which was not that much worse.. The sound was pretty loud be it media sound, ringtones, call sound, etc.Frankly speaking, I've not checked gaming, camera and other features the way I did with sound quality. I'd recommend experience yourself before you buy this phone if at all possible.
"
288,"  Good phone for the price. The responsiveness of the screen to touch is a little wanting. Battery not as good as expected, lasts for about a day and a half with moderate usage.  Camera is great but it's a pain to select and toggle through the settings. Really have to look hard to realise it is a high resolution image. My other purchase is an M12 which feels really premium compared to this phone. The price difference at time of purchase was only 2k.
"
289,"  Firstly amazon cc is very inefficient in handling my queries, series of wrong communication from chat support, phone support. My email is not yet answered since 8 days. Now, samsung m12 phone - out of 64gb only 50-52gb is available and remaining 12-13gb occupied by system. Out of 4gb ram 1.8gb approx is occupied by system. Camera quality is very very poor. Phone hangs too much like if i unlock the phone it takes more than 10-15 sec to display clock, navigation icons, notifications panel etc. Phone heats up if we use gdrive, maps, hotspot. Screen and body is very delicate. Plz think much before you go for this. An upset frustrated Amazon cusromer, Sameer!
"
290,"  Its a budgeted phone. 6 GB/ 128 GB storage variant is good. Battery backup is awesome. Took 3-3.5 hrs to full charge. Not happy with front camera quality & Awful at night. NO slow motion capturing feature. Rear camera is better in daylight & good at night. Not happy with side touch sensor. Took so many attempts sometimes to unlock. But, overall I am happy using it because navigation sensor, battery backup & performance of phone is good compared with other brands.
"
291,"  Great product for the money. Thankfully it's not Chinese and there's peace of mind when using banking apps or other apps which warrants security of non Chinese servers. The camera to screen everything is as good it can get for the money and software is way above what the Chinese offers.
"
292,"  After use of one month i can say,Excellent battery life, sound quality is good, Its not easy to handle due to its heavyness but it can be bcos of 6000mah battery. Fingerprint sensor is good. Camera quality is not good as expected from 48 mega pixels. Front camera is not good at all. But overall experience till now is very Good. Want to give 5star but one star less due to its camera and Handling.
"
293,"  Samsung camera is supposed to be far better than Lyf Wind, regretably it is on par. You could sell this lower end of the product range for may be 7000 or max 7500. Beats many local brands yet not satisfactory. Giving a 4 starFeed back: Sold my old Wind Lyf phone for Rs 1350 to a small dealer. Rs 450 exchange value is not fair at all.
"
294,"  like you I have searched the reviews for this mobile..just keep this two things in your mind while you choose to buy this mobile.1. If you are a low range mobile user and u trying to buy high range mobile then this is the perfect mobile with exotic features and to perfect price like 10500.2. If you are a high range user mobile price of above 15000 then this will be little low campares to that m12 but m12 gives it own best Performances.You can't  compare this mobile 10500rps  to the mobiles above 15000 because  if you put plus money then it comes with  more features  that's the difference..so you must compare the features with price tags then scroll to the reviews  for performance of the mobile  like you and me! Conclusion:-  Review is only for this mobile so...this kind a features with this price is absolutely  worth it. Performance  was damn good of every features and last Final finger print sensor is a exotic feature in this mobile the it works is like DAMN GIRL!Thank you.
"
295,"  I have just picked it up in budget category for day to day needs, well I'm not disappointed with my choice it's a great package to offer at this price point keeping my needs in mind.However the phone is very sluggish in response, if you're looking for performance from this phone kindly stay away it will disappoint you.Hope my review helps prospective buyers.
"
296,"  After using since 5 days......1. 90Hz display really smooth2. Camera quality little better if you select 48M camera setting . Not really good one for photography.3.battery backup is too good, as I am not a gamer4. Too heavy to carry ...After using with back cover it feels almost 500 GM to me5. Voice clarity is really good.6. 4G speed is awesome.7. Overaally it's a nice phone ......
"
297,"  Bought this phone a week ago.Budget Phone for people who need a good smart phone at lower rate with good battery backup of 6000mah.Phone is not very heavy, screen is bigger which is good for watching movies/videos.Negative: keypad is not showing fully when using upi mobile app.Otherwise phone is good.Will write more reviews after using it for some more time
"
298,"  This product is fantastic for this price! I tested the Battery life and for a heavy user, it can easily last you and day or a day and a half. And for a light user, it can last you 2 - 3 days! Also, the cameras are decent, the front camera is ok in low light or in some cases indoor lighting, but the front camera is pretty good! I have seen phones with these exact same features for double the price! The screen is respectable it's not pixely, but it's not the best ofc. The screen is pretty smooth, its 90hz is really nice and smooth. Gaming on this phone is ok. I mean like I told you the battery can last you a long time, and the same thing applies to gaming now ofc the battery will run out faster but not significantly faster. Playing the actual game its self is decent only the VERY high-powered games is a bit laggy on this phone but most of the games work smoothly. I would give this phone a 4 star just because the front camera could have been better.
"
299,"  1) Look and feel of the mobile is good but little heavier due to 6000 mAH battery.2) Camera quality is good but slow - takes more time to save the picture.3) Fingerprint reader is good.4) Overall performance is slower.5) Battery support - 2 days under normal use.
"
300,"  It got deliver on 14th April. After using few days I find my moto phone was better in features. I am not able to take screenshot using power button + vol down button. It always show Power off + restart + emergency.Motion and guestures features are limited compare to moto. No option for 3 finger touch screen shot or palm slide screenshot. Rest is ok. Not much imprressed.

301,"  I ordered it on 2nd of may and got it on 5th of may. I am pretty much with which which the phone comes. This phone has really exceeded a lot of expectations regarding the features that its loaded with. But the only thing with which  I am disappointed with is its size🤔, its quiet ""fat""😅to say. But really.... I am astonished with its battery backup. It's a huge for phones in this price range. It comes with 6000mah battery which I felt, a #monster precisely😳. The camera....OMG!!!!!its just too good. It comes with 84mp quad camera . It has a 10x zoom, which is super clear. The fingerprint reader is mounted on the side,down the volume button. It's too awesome. It  senses the print, even on a thin plastic sheet is placed on it. Other than all this , to say, it a great budget friendly and a must buy on the other hand. It should be in one's list , if he/she is looking for the #monster in 10k bracket💯👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼

302,"  1. To begin with battery life is pretty good, however it takes little longer to fully charge the phone.2. Front came is pathetic. Rear camera is some how ok for basic usage.3. Fingerprint will work whenever it wants to (not everytime you need it) so remember phone pinlock to be on a safer side.4. Phone got hanged twice within 15 days of normal usage.5. Overall this is a phone for elderly person or for someone who is low to minimal user on a daily basis.
"
303,"  Bought this new phone for my mom on 5th Oct.. the day I recieved the phone I had issue with camera quality (checked and confirmed by Amazon technician as well) also faced issue with dialler tone while making call.. there was no sound of the dialler tone.. Amazon replaced and sent me a new phone on the 9th Oct.The new phone had no issue with Camera but issue with dialler tone was still there. I raised the issue with Amazon and they provided me an appropriate solution with amazing service and initiated the refund.I don't think Samsung phones are worth buying at the price range of below 10k.I might prefer going for Realme, MI, Vivo or any other brand over Samsung.
"
304,"  I bought this phone for my mother as a secondary phone.Gamingbwas our of question, needed good battery life and goo calling support.Pros -Battery Life is amazing, the phone never heats up. No matter what.It's a sub par processor. But does the normal job. Don't play or install any games on this. Use it for calls, media.One UI is clean. But make sure to delete all the junk apps and disable swing seevices.90Hz is actually visibleCamera bump is non existentThere is WiFi calling, unlime a lot of people suggest.ConsHeavy and thick phone.Stutters when you give it some intense job.No 5GHz WiFiColours aren't the best at this price. Display could have been much better. But won't notice Unless you compare it side by side.For 10k it's a good buy for a light user.If you're a heavy user. Go for Poco M3 or Redmi Note 10 or Micromax In1 if ur budget is 10k.
"
305,"  I am writing review after using almost 1month of using this phone, so please take serious before buying this. There is no return policy only replacement available. So think twice.Please dont fall in offer, worst phone ever, always ask for software update.Heavy in weight.Camera Quality poor.Battery life poor.Sound Quality poor.Don't fall in rat race.
"
306,"  I am reviewing this after 2 months of usage! It was good ! It is little heavy compared to other samsung mobile! The battery life is good... But not as worth for 6000mah! I don't play games i just use social media! For social media useage its bit Oke! And the camera! Seriously! 48mp is not that good its Oke! Just oke!! But its totally budget friendly!
"
307,"  For its cost, I believe the phone is worth it. Till now, it hasn't shown any problems. Everything works fine. Battery is magnificent. Only problem is the fingerprint sensor. It is on the side on top of the power button. So, the space is very small. Most of the back covers or flip covers cover this fingerprint sensor partially and the device does not unlock.
"
308,"  The ear piece speaker is not working from day one . I had gifted the phone to a senior citizens. He was using the phone on speaker mode. He did not tell me about it until I found him using speaker to talk. By the time I came to know about the issue 7 days had past. Now no return option available. And I went to samsung authorised service centre there they don't have spares to rectify the problem. So still we are using the phone with speaker on. Did not expect such a quality from a big brand like samsung. Feeling very disappointed.
"
309,"  All over best phone to buy at this price range.Pros-*UI is too easy to operate very fast based on android one.*Battery 🔋 is too good giving back-up upto 10 hrs of heavy duty.*Charger is 15w slidely charging fast.*Display is very power efficient & size is good.*No heating issue.*Security review is good*Processor Speed is likely good.*Fingerprint sensor is very fast & side mountedCons-*Camera features are not given like pro mode, slow-motion, fast motion.*Photo quality need to be more advanced.*Device is little bit thik causing of the powerful 6000 mah battery.*Display is not so bright also not so dark & colour are not displaying as expected.*Expected amoled display as Samsung always given in the past.*Speaker sounds like good but volume is not so loud*Weight is little bit heavy.
"
310,"  I got the product delivered super-fastt in just 3 days.. I got my Asus Max Pro M1 exchanged  and I must say it was a terrific  experience . Amazon  gave close to Rs.4500 of my 3 year old phone. However,  I must mention that my old phone had no cracks or dents, so that did not diminish its value and was in a good working condition. Battery life is the best part of this phone, it easily lasts for 2 days with moderate usage and 1 full day if you are a gamer or a heavy user. It takes close to 2½ hrs to charge fully. Coming to the cons, the camera is just average and you will be disappointed if you  buy the phone for the camera. The 90hz is smooth. Overall,  I would give this phone a 9/10.
"
311,"  Speaker output is low. You will notice this if you consume media using phone's speakerIt has a bug in touch screen out of the box. Gets fixed with first update.It doesn't have proximity sensorBattery life is the biggest positive. On normal usage I get around 2 days battery life with around 11 hours screen time

313,"  Built quality GoodBattery 🔋is Super GoodCamera you can expect more than this from a phone costs 10kPhone is lagging too much of you have more than 15 apps.Very slow performance.I am not a gamer also I don't play any single game. But still the device runs slow.
"
314,"  Samsung’s M12 of a 90Hz screen is a budget phone. the giant 6,000mAh battery and clean UI make up for it to some extent, making the Galaxy M12 a decent buy.The Galaxy M12 feels rigid and offers a firm construction. There is no fingerprint sensor on the back with Samsung choosing instead to integrate it with the power button.good to see Samsung using a USB Type-C port for its affordable devices, and that is present at the bottom alongside the 3.5mm headphone jack and speaker grille. he display on the Galaxy M12 is a 6.5-inch HD+ (720 x 1,600) TFT panel that has a 90Hz adaptive refresh rate. In its price range, the Galaxy M12 appears to be the only phone with a high refresh rate. the display is a standard panel with healthy peak brightness, controlled saturation levels, and minimal colour shift when viewed at an angle. A quad-camera system is present on the Galaxy M12 which comprises a 48MP primary sensor with an f/2.0 aperture, a 5MP secondary ultra-wide lens with a massive 123-degree field of view, a 2MP depth, and a 2MP macro sensor. As far as budget phones go, the Galaxy M12 does a decent job of capturing details  At night, the camera is a bit inconsistent and a slight shake can induce blurriness in the shots. I keep my expectations about low-light photography in check from a lot of budget phones, but the M12 is above average and good. Lastly, you get a beefy 6,000mAh battery that is very likely going to last you two days on moderate usage.
"
315,"  after using the phone almost 4 months1. phone is not super fast what company is claiming infact it is slow sometimes.2. If fully charged battery stays 24 to 30 hours even after heavy use but problem is with the time taken for the battery charging is toooo long. so people having busy schedule will always face low in battery, and searching for where to charge 🤔. 15 amp charger kaun deta hain re Samsung?3. M series has bad reputation for software essue but I Did not faced yet except Bluetooth sometimes turned off automatically while listening music.Overall price has dropped 1000 Rs now. I bought it at 10500 Rs. You can buy it, sexy looks. works well.
"
316,"  Honestly the phone deserves a rating of 4.5 (deduction 0.5 due to certain minuses of missings like absence of dual band etc)...Overall, the phone feels extremely premium to use with high refresh rate, reasonably fast & zappy processor, good primary camera etc.Another major factor to consider is that the phone is extremely well built & the weight is very evenly distributed....
"
317,"  For price  5/5For battery life  4.5/5For performance  4/5For storage  4.5/5For Camera  4/5But for Sound  3/5Now u know it's good phone in this budgetI bought this in 10,000 /-Apart from sound range... it's well to do phone

318,"  It does not come with back cover, screen guard, sim slot pin.Charger wire is very small.Display is averageOppo & Vivo displays are far better comparativelySoftware is bit laggy and not so ease of use.Software features are not great
"
319,"  Battery is goodBlazing fastDon't read Amazon reviews ,at this price point this is the best fast Samsung phone you will get.Camera is very good for normal use.48 MPMacro mode is very goodCamera usage in low light is great.8nm processor is power efficientThe new Samsung software is fast. User friendly .some people's are saying about UPI PIN entering issues.but I found it not a big issue. A small part of number is not seen. But still we can type. It's not an issue.Overall the phone is awesome.
"
320,"  Face recognition is slow. otherwise the phone is super awesome. My 4 months old iPhone se 2020 ran into some hardware issues, due to pandemic I couldn't service it. So I brought this m12 phone, just to be in budget for obvious reason. This phone is under 9999 and if your expecting performance similar to a 40k, then your review needs a think over. This phone exactly does or does more than what it's priced. If you are low budget and want more out of it with some limitations, go for it.
"
321,"  Camera  :  Not Good (not up to mark  48 mp)Battery  :  GoodDisplay  :  Not good (like local )Charger with phoneNo back cover with phoneNo ear phone with phoneMany  problem  with phone  you  can say poor quality  of  product o r  below average Mon youtube and  others  they  are  making foolish  about  phone review

322,"  VIDEO CAN NOT TO BE SENT TO WHATS APP, EVEN 5/6 MINUTES OF VIDEO, ONLY ONE STILL PHOTO & OBLY 10 MINUTES VIDEO IN GALLARY SHOWING THAT THE STORAGE IS FULL ALSO SYSTEM IS NOT SUPPORTING TO SHOOT ANY VIDEO OR TAKE ANY PHOTO. SINE THE DAY WE HAVE  ACTIVATED PHONE ON 15TH dEC BY AIRTEL SIM, VERY RARELY USING PHONE AS VIDEO SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING AS PER OUR REQUIRMENTS. SO PLZ SUGGEST BEST SOLUTION OF THIS PROBLEM AS I PURCHASED THIS PHONE FOR VIDEO UPLOADING PURPOSE.
"
323,"  Wonderful phone for the provided price. This was bought for my father .I was using one plus 7 pro and due to repair I was forced to use this phone for a week and to be honest other than camera I was more than satisfied with this mobile and its performance
"
324,"  Such a modern phone but doesn't recognize 5G bandwidth of wifi. Fingerprint reader on lock button is in a very wrongfully place. Phone locks and unlocks because of it. So now have to register a different finger for unlocking and use different finger for locking the phone.
"
325,"  If you are looking mobile at this rate ....the best choice is this m12....really loved its features..prons:1)battery life 6000mah it would come for 1 1/2 day with average use2)display was really amazing really loved this huge display..colour,sound was simple good3)camera are nice i took some good shots from them4)it comes with nice os operator +andriod 11.0 v is good in it..5)Soft touch and fringer print and face detection sensor also works well.cons:1)The processor can be better...this processor is good for average usage and average graphics games2)The weight is some what more....finally good phone for this cost compared to all other phone at this range...
"
326,"  I read reviews about the battery life and camera and went for this phone. Its good on all aspects except the speaker volume. Even the call ringtone is low on volume. If you work in noisy environment then this phone won't suit you. Even listening to songs on speaker is low on volume. This is a compromise you have to make.
"
327,"  Using Samsung smartphone after many years. But have to admit samsung smartphones improved a lot as compared to TouchWiz days. Performance, camera are very good on this device. Battery life excellent. All features functions as intended to be. No bugs in software. User experience is really great. Delighted with this purchase.
"
328,"  I would say seller needs to do work with packaging 📦 and. phone delivered to me in good condition but over all its goodAbout phone it is a mid range phone if you are avrage phone user so it is good choice for you 1.Camera is ok 2.Phone performance is ok according to this price 3.Build quality is ok its fully plastic material 4.about display do not expact supper hd displays its ok not so good not so badMy opinion if are buying this for kid, mom , dad ,go for it
"
329,"  First what I like1. Great battery backup. I charge the phone on morning and just need to realx. It goes whole day without need to recharge.2. Good camera phone in the price range. Fair3. Good for games that I play. But yes, not the best gaming experience.What I didn't like:1. Hang sometimes.

331,"  and the most imp thing when u give it in service the just take money and do nothing I m fed up of this phone, now this phone is a liability on me the camera quality is not good at all for close range it's ok but for distance it's 3rd classI suggest u guys never buy this phone.
"
332,"  It's been 20 days since I'm using my Samsung M12. There are so many difficulties I'm facing since then. It's  honestly not been a good experience so far. 2nd slot of the sim doesn't work most of the time, so can't make requent outgoing calls from the same. Every now and then, I've to Turn Off & On the Sim2 slot, then only it works fine. Also camera quality is pathetic. One major problem is with the fingerprint sensor. For 1st 10 days, it was working superb, but now the fingerprint  sensor mostly fails in recognising & opening the phone. Also, sometime my phone lags while working on multiple apps. Overall I'm very disappointed.Only 2 pros of this phone: Low budget & superb battery backup.
"
333,"  I ordered samsung galaxy m12 in blue color. I got used product with open seal. I called the Amazon and they agreed to return it. Thankfully!What I noticed about this model was it looks cheap.. As back is made up of cheap plastic. It's very heavy, which is not comfortable to use. Camera quality was awful for a 48 megapixel camera (Redmi camera is much better in same pixels) . It's shocking and disappointing.I did use this mobile so can't say anything about performance and battery life. Overall it's a series of disappointments.If you have a low budget(8550 after bank discount) then go for it! Else I recommend micromax in 1 or any other brand with good ratings. It's for normal usage, best for old parents who don't need much Features. Anyone other then that, is a BIG NOO.
"
334,"  It’s a beast phone with a huge battery.The UI is also very simple and the screen is very lively.Camera is good ( but could’ve been better)At this price point, can’t really complain though - performance is also really for a phone priced under 15,000.
"
335,"  1. Price - Bought during GIF, was one of the cheapest in this config range.2. Camera - Average at best.3. Battery life - Very good.4. Sensors for touch - Good.5. Batteries are heavy and the mob as such is heavy in hand, don't keep them in loose pockets!!6. Browsing - Good, remove all unnecessary apps during first opening and setting up the device.Overall a good device if purchased within 9k.

"
339,"  I'm writing this review from the same phone that I ordered!! An amazing phone in an affordable price.. I ordered the one with 6GB RAM n 128 GB internal storage... overall it's working quite good for me ...it's been 10 days since I got my hands on this phone...fingerprint sensor is working great..battery life is awesome... speakers are working quite good.. n you get quad camera... camera is also pretty nice you just need to adjust the camera settings in order to get good quality pictures... it might not be 'the best' camera for many but it's good guys!!  Overall just go for this without any second thought.... even if you don't like it, Amazon eases your task with its 7 days replacement policy.... so it's not risky to order it online... good delivery service 👍🤗
"
340,"  Worst Samsung Mobile Ever. used so many different Samsung mobiles. but M12 is just cheating by Samsung. The camera quality is so poor. It's just a VGA camera, not 48-megapixel screen colors are very low. I have a galaxy j8 its camera is lower than m12 but it is sharp. don't take they will not return the product. worst Samsung phone ever. lost 13500, and amazon service is being poor day by day.
"
341,"  You can't really complain about anything at this price point.Still some things to point out:1. Heavy as a brick 212g!! Will take some time to get used to.2. (For power users) Not full one ui. Uses one ui core. Sound Assistant, Good lock, bixby don't work.3. Not Amoled, TFT screen.4. Not a gaming phoneNow the pros:1. 90hz screen feels great2. 48mp camera is awesome, colors are good too.3. Good battery, 1.5 days backup approxOverall satisfied.
"
342,"  This is the best smartphone Samsung has launched in this segment, I received it @12.5k with card offers, and its build quality is Ok, you will get the best features in this range, the camera is gooe, its very smooth in day to day normal use.It has a 6000mAh battery, which almost lasts for around 13-14Hrs in my case. It takes some time in charging, but if we see the battery size, it's normal.cons: you cant use s secure app to secure your  apps and folder, as its not compatible with this phone, and Samsung has compromised in many features.If you dont play heavy games, you can go with this.
"
343,"  No doubt product is good but completely disappointed with Amazon because I purchased this in Great Indian Sale @ 10,299/- and next day suddenly product price shows 9,499/-……
"
344,"  The main reason going for samsung is amoled display but my bad may be I should have read specifications but it's a miss.. blindly went by brand Samsung...two major dissapointments1. There is no amoled screen...the screen is not so good where we get lesser rate MI phones with more good specs.2. There's no dual WiFi band... My wifi is set as 5ghz but this phone doesn't show up..I believe there are cheaper phones in MI and Realme with more specs than this Samsung
"
345,"  Simply an amazing smartphone from Samsung within 10k, a rival killer launched. Bought this for my dad and he is extremely satisfied with the performance, camera is decent enough, sound quality is pretty good and battery life is awesome!! Grip is good with the combi finish at the back. On the cons, a bit on the heavier side and slightly thicker compared to its rivals, but definitely not a deal breaker. With 90 Hz refresh rate, the pros surely weigh high over the cons, just go for it.
"
346,"  So heavy and thick that I have to be very careful about not dropping it on my face when in bed. Screen res is low and pixels can be seen on the screen. Flash light left On on level 5 can burn the phone. More than usual typos on the keyboard while texting or entering OTPs. Fingerprint sensor is super fast and battery back up is great.
"
347,"  The phone keeps showing a black screen with logo. And doesn't allow to use the phone even after multiple  tapping on screen or trying to use the fingerprint sensor. It takes almost 2-5 minutes for it to allow to use the phone. The issue persists while tge phone is in use or even when left idle. Hence the battery keeps draining. I tried restarting the phone but it didn't help. But the worst of all was that I switched off the phone, but the phone just turned on on its own. So their switch off doesn't work.

Finger print on the side is a great feature and extremely useful than in screen or at the back.Cons:1. Samsung could have invested a little more in the UI but apart from that rest is good.

351,"  Biggest disappointment is this latest phone  ,not able to connect to 5g, even my old moto phone am able connect to 5g wifi...also see the numeric pad display ... battery life average...check if I can replace it with other model
"
352,"  I was strongly buying Samsung phones and advise to friends also because of its robustness. But I have worst experience with Samsung Galaxy M12 as its screen picture and camera quality are third class. Even my old Mi redimi 4 phone has a better camera and screen picture (although I am not promoting it).  It was also the fault of amazon as they launch Samsung phones at the festival without assessing the quality and grading of products from its own professionals to check their worthiness. We people buy it with the name of co's such as samsung and amazon. See, how we are easily deceived by amazon company.I strongly advise people that before buying products of such range, pls check its quality from the market
"
353,"  My husband gifted this phone to my Mother. And she just love it. As we all know, Samsung is very user friendly . Any elder person who doesn’t know much about smart phones also can handle it very easily. We ordered blue one And the colour is lovely too. Any one who want 100% latest features with minimal cost can blindly go for it.
"
354,"  Nice phone....having long battery life upto 2 to 3 days on one charging... because of 6000mah battery its a bit heavier but fingerprint scanner is on lock key that is awesome thing I have seen......camera is decent too... special selfie camera bright and clear...overall nice phone
"
355,"  Is this 48MP by Samsung. The real reason why Samsung is losing to Xiaomi is this. Please do not buy this if camera is important for you.It cannot detect wifi from exactly the same location from where my Samsung On7 Pro can, Redmi 9 can and all others can. Please note that M21 and M12 have network detecting issue.

But selfie aur normal distance ke fotos  to theek hai. Meine ise online classes ke liye kharida. So iske liye theek laga. Face ID to andhere me kaam nhi karta. Battery bhi theek hai. Abhi 5dinon se classes ke lie use kia. Aur kya kahun? Amazon me jo b details dekha use dekh kar kharida. Ummid thodi si thi ki camera ke bare me. Iske alawa overall theek hai.
"
359,"  It's just 2 days of buying this phone so overall review is not possible. Few things which I want to tell about the phone. It looks and gives feeling of strong built. It's slightly heavier (though I like such phones). Battery backup is superb. Camera quality is good at this price option, front camera has noise in pictures which is common in low budget phones. Display and sound is also justifying the price. With smooth touchscreen it's overall a good budget phone which gives you a feeling of premium built and fair quality. My reason to buy this phone was the strong built quality and simple yet good design (it does not slip from hands). I got instant discount of 1000/- on buying it with HDFC card.
"
360,"  The camera is of very poor quality.Screen disply quality is not good as redmi phone don't buy this phone.I will never purchase any Samsung phone in future.Samsung is only doing marketing launching new products every day but quality of the product are very poor.I replaced the redi phone if you used the redimi phone you will never satisfied with Samsung.
"
361,"  I had bought this phone for my mom and it had severe call quality issues from the beginning and within 6 months of using it the fingerprint stopped working. I checked with the service centre and they told me that the phone had liquid damage although it never had contact with water or rain. Stay away from this garbage.
"
362,"  Total waste of money. Worst camera quality. Front camera is not even like like 1 megapixel camera. If you like to take even a single selfi, then don't go for it. Back camera is also not at all good. My old Samsung phones are far better than this one. Once you buy you have to live with it. So, don't waste your money on this M12
"
363,"  Nice product with in the price range with better battery back up. Camera quality is good..The only bad thing I observed is that wifi is getting connected 2.5ghz bandwidth networks but not getting connected for 5ghz higher bandwidth networks.. Otherwise I would have given 5.
"
364,"  I got this phone for my second contact number as my primary handset  battery  runs out very fast and I usually have very long days. But this phone's battery  really  amazed me . It's only 3.5 days I am using  but I can tell you that the battery  backup  is really  good . My first full charge ran for full 3 days with moderate usage. Looks good . UI is simple with Android 11.  Weight and grip is good . Screen is responsive . Haven't faced a real show stopper as of yet . Initial opinion is full value for money for those who are looking for descent  phone with a very good battery  life.
"
365,"  It is a phone suitable for kids or those who use phone only to make calls and watch videos in youtube. phone is of basic specs and cannot be used for multitasking.it can be used for basic things. nothing more.
"
366,"  The M12 is very low quality product in terms of display which has very faded colors and the screen is a magnet for fingerprints and other forms of dirt.It does not even have high speed WiFi (5Ghz) which I was expecting.Compared this to very marginally higher priced M21 which is leaps ahead in terms of specs and product quality.
"
367,"  Below average phone in this price range. Battery lasts only 24hrs with very normal use. Camera is below standards. Processor is not very impressive. Mi Note 10 would have been a better choice.
"
368,"  The Phone is best for middle range buyers,Negative in phone means 1000/2000 price has to reduce because of their given features .And remaining over is fine with mid rangeFingerprint is fastBattery is very goodCamera back is okay but front 8mp is some what good (because of this price has to reduce)Processor is not good for gamers.,This phone is very good to who use very less .,or normal users .  Like only calls msgs and social networks chatting.If you want camera good means don't buy this phone.Screen resolution is less due to that HD videos were not in original some what blur or like below HD.
"
369,"  There is only 1 problem I observed that  the internet is not working properly. Videos are running intermittently even on high speed Wi-Fi. Web pages also does not load as expected.Other than that working fine and all the expected feature in this range. Its fingerprint sensor in power button.

370,"  Good batry backupGood Camera  for this range i have seen all other phone in this range but samsung is the best in camera.Buildup quality is feel like mid range phoneScreen is so nice like amoledSound output is so clear and punchy.Samsung UI is better all other chinies smart phone.Screen is very big phone waight distribution is very comfirty.If you wana give this phone to your love one i will 100% recomend you trust me you will never regreatI have also buy 2 quantity for personal and home uses.I got it in 8549 in festive sale with HDFC credit card
"
371,"  Worst Phone I have ever Seen with this price. Nothing is good except battery. Camera quality is very poor, Phone is very heavy, Sound quality is very poor. I will never recommend to anyone to buy Samsung Phone. One of my friend had recommended to go with Samsung phone. I think he has no idea about the quality of phone.
"
372,"  Bad product heavy weight if you use one plus. I bought this for mailing and what's app so it's working ok. At this price it's a quality product but don't expect performance like one plus or high priced phones. Battery life doesn't seems to perform like 6000 it's bad
"
373,"  Samsung Galaxy M12 is an excellent handset. I am writing this review after of using the mobile for three weeks. The battery back up is unimaginable . Once it gets fully charged it runs for around 40 hours with frequent usage of internet. This set consists every unique feature that Samsung offers. The camera is good but not excellent. Nevertheless the sound of loudspeaker is little down. That is to say if the volume is not highest then it becomes a bit hard to listen.To conclude i would say that the configuration which this handset consists within this price range is just beyond imagination. This is an excellent handset Samsung launched.

376,"   Very good, Don't dwell on the negetive review. Camera is pretty good, UI is very user friendly, Fingerprint sensor is at side on the lock screen button so no back side look is clean & the sensor works perfectly and flawlessly. Long battery life.
"
377,"  This is good product battery life is awesome internal memory is good 128GB good for gaming is mid range mobile.lttle bit heavy weight. Acchi mobile hai 12 hajar ke andar game khelne k liye v best hai.battery v bahut chalti hai.but camera utna accha nahi h.baki sab thik h wajan thoda jyada hai
"
378,"  Samsung is simply cheating customers by booming the non credible features , the given features are just a paper tiger ( only for advertising ) don't misunderstand it will perform. it is just a budget phone nothing rather thanDon't think against the given features by Samsung . if you need a budget phone , can buy it else if you want a performance phone please Don'tOnly battery is good
"
379,"  bought on  Amazon festival sale. After 10 days received phone. To my surprise phone was not charging and on trouble shooting found issue in charging cable. Didn't expect this quality from Samsung. Delay  of delivery is pinching too. I could have bought in a in person store and avoided all these hassles. raised return but didn't get call even after 15days was forced to used phone and buy my own cable. if something goes wrong only god can save.. don't trust amazon nor these vendors.. amazon stopped picking my support calls.
"
380,"  Galaxy M12 review after 2 weeksPros:Battery lifeOperating system (one ui core)90hz bright displayDecent camera qualityWeight distribution was good,feels lightDesign looks goodCons:1.Not sure with performance,day to day tasks are quite good,but for gaming i think it os not suitable2.Camera doesn't have fancy features but still fineFinally at low expectations i bought this product to my mom but i like it more than my phone for some time.Samsung is a brand.I had disabled most of ads,blotware and heavy apps in order to give best experience.Best for day to day use ☺️
"
381,"  Camera quality is good if compared to other phones in this range. Phone feels really fast, thanks to the 90Hz screen and 6gb RAM with a fast processor. I bought in under exchange offer for 10,000 ( 6gb variant ) and I am quite satisfied with my purchase. Go for it if you are tight on a budget yet want a phone with good specs. Much better than similar budget Chinese phones. But note that front camera could have been better, although it is 8mp but still gives grainy images. Phone was delivered in perfectly new condition.
"
382,"  The weak point is camera both side is really not so good an average quality of camera but Okey!Second one is charging speed is tooo slow 15 W 😂 about 3 hours + take to full up!But I brought for my uncle so I think this was the best smartphone for him..Under 10k superb smartphone.(Grate indian festival sale offer)
"
383,"  Pros:Good display, good battery life.Cons:1. Pros are already present in other phones.2. Camera quality is very bad. Pictures are not very grainy and not sharp. Colors look dull. Photos are comparable to older nokia phone pictures.3. Touchscreen is not very responsive and also not smooth.4. One of the biggest con is that it does not support 5GHz wifi.Overall, if you are looking for budget phone i would suggest better go for redmi note series.Even though it a budget phone it still doesn't justify its price tag. There are much better phones in the market at this price range.
"
384,"  Excellent smartphone, excellent picture, value buy. All features are excellent in this price range. The picture & sound quality is very good. Only problem is the charging port is not universal. Thus I have bought a charging cable only. Otherwise excellent.
"
385,"  The fingerprint sensor is on mode button. it is not comfortable. Lightly stuck the back touch button. Camera quality is not in 48 pixel and front not good.It is over the look not good and fully not bad. But I am not satisfied the amount of worth
"
386,"  Please don't buy this...The data conctivity was really terrible...And I tried changing Sim card to my old phone..In old ph the data was connecting good and speed also good....And while I am in voice call, when I turn on the speaker only the other can hear my voice if I off speaker, they are unable hear my voice.Worest product!!!😢😢😢Please don't go with this!!!No screen recorder, no shortcut yo screenshot, but unwanted apps will download without our permission from galaxy store.Back camera is also not up to the mark!!!Very very bad experience!!!
"
387,"  Good to go piece.Few cons which I have noticed:• Specs may say camera megapixels are higher, but not in par with MI phones.• Cannot run dual apps for applications other than messenger.• Sudden issue arised in first week of use where speakers started screaming harshly with noise (trrrrrrrr) whenever some sound played(notifications, music). Luckily resolved after a reboot. (saw some other users having similar issues over support forum)
"
388,"  Samsung M12.  Camera clarity is absolutely worst and bad normal Camera phone is better than  ,And  mobile is  getting over heated  badly  in all times when Iĺ operate, over all Samsung M12 performance is not good.i purchased this mobile for camera purpose. I just blindly trusted Amazon before buying Samsung M12, now in not happy with this.One of ""Best Worst mobile"" in Samsung series.Amazon thought me very  good lesson, purchasing mobile from them, never ever I won't purchase anything in Amazon , By these Amazon heir trusted  and confidence.  🙏🙏🙏 Thanq.
"
389,"  I have been using this phone for last 2 months.The battery backup of this phone is too good. It lasts for 2 or 3 days with low usage. Camera is good.The fingerprint sensor responds quickly.In this price range it is worthy.
"
390,"  Horrible..bought  this phone on launch date.camera quality is worst..and the performance is below average. Don't waste your money by buying  this.Since I brought  it under replacement policy not able to return  it now. Worst phone from samsung
"
391,"  Hi friends don't purchase this phone with any expectation.Problem.1. Phone over heating during while charging2. Camera not equal to 48 MP3. Finger print reader not upto mark.It's on ordinary phone under 10k.Really disappoint with this product. Samsung failed to maintain their standard.
"
392,"  Samsung is truly a Monster with 6000 mAh battery with 8 nm processor. 128 GB Internal memory is really good to have along with 6 gb RAM where the games r loading very smoothly. True 48 Mp quad camera is truly wise to capture the photos. The phone is very slim and 90 hz refresh rate is really awesome. 16.55 cm infinity V display is cool. In total this mobile is one of the best to have at this range of prices. Moreover the backside of the phone is having a matte finish which is very good and not slippery.
"
393,"  Unnecessary samsung apps, which you can't uninstall. If you are not tech savvy, you are gonna face lot of problems. All the unnecessary apps will be automatically downloaded. There are pre installed apps, you neither can uninstall nor block notifications.Camera is worst in this price range. No fast charging opting available. Battery life is good. Finger print reader is ok.
"
394,"  Mobile is too bulky.. and thickness is too much 9.7 mm. Not looking like modern phone. Samsung pls work on weight and thickness. Customer won't require big battery give 5000mah is enough. Give some modern look with max 8.5 mAh thickness.. talk about procesdor its entry level processor of 6-7 k phones. But u give in 11k phone.. atleast use G35.
"
395,"  If you're not a heavy gamer or user you can definitely go for this this is a budget phone and excellent for running moderate and lit apps for our daily use ... and there will be no lag and have a very good battery life ... camera is average and UI is good
"
396,"  Please everyone attention don't but this Mobile because this Mobile is not good battery backup same as 5000 mah battery  and I used 6000 mah battery other Mobile tecno spark 7t that Mobile's Mobile battery is more batter than m12And camera quality is very  bad experience in this mobile only name is 48 mega pixels  but quality is 16 mega pixels  aur front camera is very poorPlease everyone don't buy this mobile I you want to buy please but tecno spark 7t same features in this Mobile
"
397,"  I wanted to have a phone 6 GB RAM and 128 GB ROM and 7000 mAH battery with large display and good picture quality in budget. This phone has satisfied me a lot, however this phone has 6000 mAH battery. I am much satisfied now. After one year or more than one year, It should not be slow and hang. I will rate this phone 8 number out of 10.However it's a better deal.
"
398,"  13 to 14 k you will get better than this Samsung m12. The day I started use, phone started hanging,I should honestly give the reviewGo for other phone it doesn't give 6000mah woser than my old Lenovo phone 3500mah.Camera is average they give lots number of MP but not suited at all , only good thing is finger print senso even that too I doubt about it how long days I can have without problem.Finally I m not satisfied with M12, 6GB Ram phone is not working as the attractive description given below the list. Hopeless product
"
399,"  Quite disappointed with the phone. Recently bought. Already the battery charging is very slow. The camera is mediocre. It lacks night mode and the picture quality is average. Colours are not rue to colour. Will not recommend this phone.
"
400,"  As a regular smartphone user i will rate this item 4 out of 5 because in such price it should be much better like in 48 mp camera the picture quality is not as good as my expectation. Fingerprint and face unloch is quite good and the selfie camera really excellent. As 6000mAh battery the battery should last upto 1day and a half but in standard use the battery quality decreases upto 29% in the evening (I charged the phone around 6.40 am on that day). This problem that I faced I had share with you all guys, before buying this phone please think a lot and tge decisions is completely upon you. Thank You, Arnab Bindu Chakraborty
"
401,"  Amazing battery life. Discharge is only 1% for overnight.Display can be much better. Expected a better display from samsung. Vivo and oppo have a better display interms of brightness and pixel density.Finger print on power button is good and quick.Plastic back is kind of disappointing.Overall performance is ok but not what the ADS on amazon show you.
"
402,"  Don't see the negative reviews.  After using 10days I am writing this reviews .Back camera excellentFront camera okBattery excellentCharging Full for 2.30 hours approxLittle more weight, but not so heavyDisplay excellentNo heating,  no hangingVolume and speakers excellentAround 10k budget excellent.Samsung is best brand and provenThanks to Amazon
"
403,"  Actually I am a fan of samsung.I brought this variant with 11k @ diwali offer.I thought to buy other mobile instead of Samsung in this price where I can get additional features, but surprisingly samshng m12 made me feel good after buying this phone.Main thing is performance no lag even I am playing asphalt 9, Ram management is super and samsung UI  is great experience  as you can see in high end mobiles.Charging is fast and long last.Disappointed thing is only 📷.Totally I am 😊 with this 📱 in this price Range.Recommended and for it, As of now 6gb varaint is about 14k wait for drop 11k and proceed.
"
404,"  Bought this for my parents and they love it. As I am using A52 myself, I feel M12 delivers at its price range and then some. The fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate. Having 90 Hz Adaptive display is wonderful.Camera is decent as well, with options for Macro (attached) and Wide Angle being good as well. Haven't experienced any lags on medium workloads.Android 11 with updated UI, Smart View, Dolby Atmos, Good Battery Life are some highlights.Very satisfied with the purchase.
"
405,"  The battery life is way better than any of the smartphone in the same range and the person is also good as it has 6 gb ram but camera quality can be little bit better and they could have improved the processor. Good thing is that all apps are optimised which is good for the battery life .It's a great product if you are a kind of person who wants a smartphone which has a longer battery life ,a good speed and 90hz refresh rate and who doesn't do gaming in the smartphone.
"
406,"  i feel like cheated by amazon and samsung its not even a month and my phone stopped working with no reason this was not expected and visited to samsung centre as well but they were saying that only non warranty sets are getting fixed during this lockdown period then i asked them to fixed my set out of warranty (i was ready to pay as well) then they said that your mobile display is need to be change and there is no display available in India for my phone and from that day i am not having any smartphone as i am saving money and trying to bear this pain n loss.amazon hats off to u cheaters.
"
407,"  Got this as a replecement for my samsung M11. The M12 is way better than M11. Better photo quality, better performance and faster performance. I got the blue phone which looks decent as well. I feel it's worth the 13500 I paid for it.
"
408,"  The phone received in a day. Thanks Amazon for quick delivery. The phone's display, camera, battery life is good. But one issue I found it. Recently I realize it that once I receive incoming call am not able hear it for couple of minutes / sometimes no voice heard from other side and finally I need to close the call ....initially I thought this issue should be from sender phone but now I realize it is in my phone...it appears that either there is problem in my phone or in model. Samsung and Amazon to look into this issue & replace it with good phone on immediate  basis.
"
409,"  - battery life is super- camera quality is ok in such price segment- bought this phone at 8599  with 1039 rs credit card discount- build quality  is best
"
410,"  Not amoled display but at this price you don't deserve amoled, it is an hd display but u deserve new android 11 but it is based on android 10 and needed the "" one ui "" updated version. My old phone m30 is 2 year old but it has awesome features in "" one ui "" but this has not,  hope software update gave all this features.  But battery life is awesome and camera is average. 🙂🙂

414,"  Pros:1. Entry level budget smart phone2. Battery levels are amazing3. 90Hz refresh is plusCons:1. Finger print sensor does not picks up elderly person's finger2. Face lock is also not up to the mark3. Brightness levels of the display are not up to the mark when compared to other 12k to 15k M series budget phones
"
415,"  The phone is good. Of course it justifies its price range. But this phone has a low audio output,so putting a speaker during call,or while playing other media files, the sound is not very high even when kept at full volume. Other than that, the phone is great.
"
416,"  After 1 month use, some serious sensors are missing which will make google maps almost useless on the phone. Camera quality is good only for day time that too depends on mood of the camera. Sluggish phone you can see phone saving photo even after quiting the camera app. Serious processor problems. I bought 6/128 variant and felt sorry for whoever bought 4 gig version. Good for minimal users and for saving tonns of photos via apps but not from the phone's camera. BGIM was surprisingly good on the phone thanks to its large screen. Also good for online classes and OTT viewers.
"
417,"  Literally value for money in this prize by Samsung.I could blindly recommend you this phone if you are samsung lover..Everything is just latest...Pros:-Type c port6000mah massive batteryAndroid 11One UI OS 3.1  no blaotwares at allFingerprint sensor is blazing fast works 10 out of 10 times..Amazingle processor is on 8nm technology..Cons:-HD + displayFace unlock not reliableCharger is 15 watt which could be of 20 wattsOverall a all rounder phone in 11,000  by reliable brand samsung.
"
418,"  Worst phone hangs a lot from the day of purchase various problems. Keyboard gets cut in half during some apps hang while calling ... Not able to pick up calls smoothly.
"
419,"  In almost one year, 3 times display screen has color leak issue (without any handset fall/physical damage) which company never covers under warranty. 3 times paid from my pocket Rs.4800 each time to rectify the issue. Highly disappointed with company poor development policy. Planned to never buy samsung products in future.

"
421,"  Lovely 4 camera design though no 5ghz wifi and 90hz don’t know what’s the difference between normal or this. But overall at this price point loaded. Better than Chinese. Yes of course Unnecessary apps could be reduced that come preinstalled.

423,"  Using this for more than a month now for not so heavy usage.Battery Life is VERY impressiveCharger is although 18W, still provides more than expected speed of charging.Side mounted fingerprint is pretty quick.Speakers provide just above average sound.Camera is good although not as good as proclaimed 48MP, wide angle and portrait mode available.All and all, this phone has not disppointed me.But would suggest to research other options like Redmi note 10 and compare them yourselves.

I have to restart the mobile then need to connect again. It is very annoying.I didn't have this problem with my previous mobile and also I don't have any coonectivity issues with my wife's mobile if I use mobile Hotspot on it. Mywife's mobile is lesser in configuration when compared to this mobile. We both have same mobile connection which is Vodafone.I don't know what to to do.
"
430,"  This is my solid rankingafter using Galaxy M12 for a fortnight.Ovweall performance is quite good and comfortable.It would be better if atleast 25 w charger is provided with a big battery.Some critics on you tube had informed "" 4 to 5 problems"" in all(?) M series phones but I have found none of them in this product although it is of very reasonable price.I am 85 today and yet enjoy my ph. Without any difficulty.SAMSUNG has never any excuse|!
"
431,"  I bought this phone before 2 months, Camera is very poor 48 MP it is poorer than 13 MP.I wanted to login my company email, before that device needs to be enrolled with Microsoft Intune company portal. The company portal will only allow when Device encryption feature will be available in phone, but it does not have.This is very important hardware features that secure your phone,s data. So this phone is use less for me to configure outlook.So Guys..Be aware if you are buying any phone and which phone's price is falling day by day...

"
435,"  Phone does not support 5 GHz band for wifi due to this slow internet compared to my old phonePhone is not at all slim, thick phoneIt has a 6000Mah battery but still it drains very fast compared my old oppo F11.Camera performance is just okay.Finger scanner is placed on the side of the body, not comfortable to usePhone is without screen guard and back cover. brand could have provided in the box it would have not added much cost to them.
"
436,"  In this price range for the moment one of the best deals. 6000mAh battery really does the job. Fingerprint reader is sensitive but if you using mobile with cover it becomes difficult due to its position. Camera not great not terrible. Touch sensitivity is not that great sometimes it slides when I want to open an app but not that major problem. If you want something with high battery and RAM and storage this is the mobile.
"
437,"  Finger print reader & camera quality excellent. It senses quickly & good resolution as far as camera is concerned. Battery life depends on usage.Moreover, From my experience  Samsung's after sale service is excellent
"
438,"  This phone is no different from other Samsung phones with respect to the usage speed. While the battery is fantastic, camera is ok. There too much lag while using phone. The worst thing is I noticed all these after my return period is over.
"
439,"  I am using this phone since 5 months and overall performance is good but camera is not like 48 mega pixels..  when you take a picture, the picture is cracked.. not clear visible..Battery life is very good.. 2 day backups in normal use.. and day in gaming use..

Overall good option in this price range ( best feature is it has 6gb ram, 128 gb internal memory at this price.)

444,"  When I received the mobile, neither the speaker nor the mic was working so I did a restart then it started working.This happened frequently so I had to restart frequently. I decided to replace the item as it was faulty but the new product I received has the same issue. Unfortunately this is not returnable so my money is wasted.Very bad experience, please avoid buying this.
"
445,"  Handset is likeable, no doubts. But the quality of display, camera and processor are not full in criteria as mentioned. I have sent a picture captured by 48 mp resolution, you will see that is not clear and  proof that the quality of camera is not good. Display resolution shows to see the diaplay you need to tilt the phone. Sometimes phone went hanged also so that the processor is not good. I have exchanged my old phone which was in well running condition now I am missing that was best against this one. That was solid in his promises. Thankyou
"
446,"  Using it from last 8 months, worth it totally 👍 used iPhone earlier and then bought this phone, one thing noticed is battery life, no comparison at all with iPhones, way better than iPhones and many smartphones of this range.Second one is Screen resolution, top quality.Third pro is storage, better than iPhone.Camera is average compared to iPhones and other smartphones so if you want good smartphone with good battery life, storage, screen resolution then must go for this phone. Totally worth it in this criteria
"
447,"  Not worth of moneyNot aviled for any special futureIts does noteven have the normal features that other mobile have😔😔😔😔😔
"
448,"  1. A good phone in this range2. Exynos 850 may not sound a great processor for gaming or multitasking, but it actually does a great job.3. No heating issues. (Playing games like FF for 1-2 hrs or attending consecutive meetings on Meet, Zoom & Teams or doing consecutive classes on Unacademy or Adda won't cause a problem)4. Although the camera quality disappointed me, as their remains a high expectation from Samsung Cameras.5. But overall Samsung lives upto its name, with great service centres and customer support.
"
449,"  As Samsung shows its quality in every launch, this is also a good product in mid range mobiles. All things are good if u r an average user, for high performance gaming & photography other high end models are preferred.

But I can play seemingly all kind of game without lag(I dont mean games like genshin imapact).Overall goodValue for money:8/10 (reason low resolution  comparedd to other  budget smart phone  under 12000)Camera:9/10 (under this price tag the camera  qualityy is good)Chipset:8/10(under this price tag)Battery:10/10(best in this price tag)Overall:7/10
"
451,"  Battery life is very good. Built quality is also very nice. Camera quality also very good. Fingerprint reader work perfectly and also fast. Overall the phone is very good. Value for money. One of the best choice this phone in this price range.
"
452,"  One UI 3.1 and 90hz display makes the user experience heavenly. It has a 8nm processor and really power efficient. Without compromising in the perfomance it gives me more than 2 days of battery life. Camera is decent and the colour reproduction is very good.No hanging or heating problems.It can run high end games in low to medium settings as well but I won't recommend this for gaming purpose.Lot's of features included with the One UI 3.1 core which I liked the most. Overally a great phone for Normal users 👌

453,"  MIc is not working properly I already bought M31 same problem with that mobile also .  My mistake is forgot that purchase and again same series phone since have good confidence over Samsung but they never maintaining good quality  . They need lot improvement over testing the product before launching in market
"
454,"  Another good product from Samsung Galaxy M12.  Battery life is very good. Performance is not as good as Qualcomm Snapdragon, but its ok. Only you will find performance difference when you play games. Features are excellent. Camera Quality also good. Value for Money in this range.
"
455,"  Best Battery, Rear Camera, And fast finger print unlockBut Samsung Galaxy M12 it's Not Support Wifi Dual Band (5GHz)Only Support Single Band (2.4GHz)Overall it's Best Only Under Rs. 8500
"
456,"  I have purchased this on 6th sep with 6 months free screen replacement. My phone screen broke in a month and when i go back to samsung service center, they denied for screen replcement. Also samsung customer care is saying amazon will do it. Amazon is saying samsung will do it.They are making fool of customers.
"
457,"  Satisfied with product. Camera quality is okay. Other than that, its a samsung, whoever is used to samsung will love the functioning of this device too.If you are a samsung lover, definately go for it. If you are conscious about new features, gaming, camera quality other options might be available at given price point. Its great for day to day tasks and surfing internet, social media and all. Thumbs up for Samsung
"
458,"  Just stopped working after few hoursIt seems it has a bug. It doesn't work for quite a few hours in the evenings. Not sure how long
"
459,"  I buy my first ever & may be last Samsung Phone because mobile phone is good for daily use only the issue which I was noticed when I trying to connect internet  & opened mobile hotspot & connected my laptop or other device  the speed of internet showing below 100 kb/sec it’s very worst & even I connected my same laptop & other devices with another mobile and same network it’s showing speed above  500kb/sec the thing is only disappointed me.
"
460,"  Its total value for money. It can handle regular usage like social media, video streaming very well.. fingerprint unlock is pretty fast... Camera and display are on bit downside but to be realistic at this price range its pretty decent. Go for it if you are looking alternative of low cost chinese.
"
461,"  I don't know why they have mentioned as 48 mega pixel , I am big fan of Samsung.Prior to this mobile I have used Samsung j6 its just 13mega pixel camera quality is just awesome. M12 camera quality is very poooooor.One more issue is Amazon not accepting return until if you receive a defective piece.
"
462,"  Bit disappointed even after spending 13500 ,you will not getting 5g on wifi this operates only 2.4 g,camera is not up to the mark....battery is good . fingerprint is on lock button this is another drawback.
"
463,"  The purpose behind my purchase is accidentally my Samsung A10 fell down and lost the display, so immediately I have selected this model without any second thought, because of the brand value, value for money, features, user-friendly what not all features.  We are happy with this purchase and the way we received our order very timely.
"
464,"  Mobile is as per expectations. Surprisingly no ear phones provided, where as when purchased from shop it is included .
"
465,"  Dear Help desk,This is Joel Deepak, I ordered Samsung Galaxy M12 mobile on 10th April 2021. The product was shipped on 12th April 2021. I received after 3- 5 days. Mobile is 1 year warranty and In box accessories is 6 months warranty.My mobile working fabulous. But, My charger head is not working.I cannot raise any complaint against that fault. That's why I posted here in review section.Please do the needful to replace or service my charger.- Joel Deepak J
"
466,"  Phone hangs several times and restarts automatically. Raised issue with Amazon customer care, but according to them, issue is not capturing in smartcheck app, hence can not be return or replace. Total waste of money.
"
467,"  Display is not that great.Battery is awesome.Camera quality is better than other chinese handsets.Samsung one ui coupled with android 11 experience is superbb. You will love it.Fingerprint reader and face unlock works fast.Speaker is loud also.Exynos chip is underperform slightly than the competion but considering it's a Samsung budget phone so overall it's worth the purchase.
"
468,"  SCREEN GOT BLANK JUST AFTER 9 DAYS OF USE.  AT THE TIME OF PURCHASING(25 SEP 21) IT WAS A AMAZON'S CHOICE PRODUCT, BUT TODAY(05 OCT 21) IT IS NOT. SO, IT'S CLEAR THAT amazon's choice TAG IS BEING USED TO CLEAR THE DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS WITH THE SUPPORT OF LUCRATIVE OFFERS. I HAVE BEEN CHEATED.

470,"  Not sure If its a good phone....I have bought it but its not working properly... throwing a lot of errors....many times calls are not going through even with full signal sometimes after call disconnected there is a strange sound which continues to ring and i have to switch off the phone....If anyone has some idea please suggest
"
471,"  The phone is a good one to use. It is a 6.5 inch but is handy to use for its balance. It has a 6000 mah battery which gives it a great battery backup with a decent fast charger. It has also a good UI( One UI 3.0). Overall it's a good smartphone which can beat some flagship phone too.
"
472,"  Well if the question comes what I dislike  about  the phone is absolutely  nothing  it is a proper handy phone allows  to have a well grip. The quad camera  allows  to take  a full depth  of a picture enrich  in color and to take a true tone photo. The finger print is fast like thunder like a touch of your finger and opens in front  of you. The battery  is cool to use you could  say a PowerBar with phone and the make and feel of the phone is like your bide on the wedding night. A cool phone to use and recommend  others.
"
473,"  Nothing  found against except it is  a little bulky ,and plastic on back is ordinary ,but it is budget phone and can not be compared with S21 or I phone .It is good for above ordinary use with occasional gaming, Battery easily last for more than two days,I can say you get more than you pay photo. In day light is very good ,uploaded photo is in low light at around 6 pmMovies on Netflix were enjoyable with good sound and colour
"
474,"  I have received the product today but as mentioned box in the details while purchasing in the box available hand set,manual, ejection pin,adopter. In the box only I have received hand set and adopter, not received the manual and ejection pin. Without ejection pin how should I put my SIM card in my mobile. I am very unhappy with that. Still I am not checking the other details in the phone. I am rated 1 star out of 5 bcoz of above issue. First impression is best impression here I am not seen very in happy.
"
475,"  Just Go For It:Great Value!! Awesome Product!! Great Service!! Samsung is the real deal 👌👌👌Better than the Advertisement!!6GB Ram 6000 Battery! Good Screen!! Decent Processor!! Every thing you need to do Is but a Breeze for M12.Last but not the least!! KNOX Security!! You can Trust Samsung with your life.I am thankful and grateful to Samsung for a great companion!! 👍
"
476,"  Regretful encounter wth this M12 order , dated 14 th Aug '21.Gifted this product to my sister, it's been just 3 mths today. Display not working, unable to start n poor battery performance.Showed at Samsung gallery for review they said mother board needs to b changed whc will cost 8 k.Please do justice to the lil investments we make around.Kindly oblige, acknowledge n respondNeed full replacement to consider.Team Amazon n collabs.
"
477,"  I am using this phone from 5 days, on this basis I am just giving my feedback.1) Fingerprint reader is different as compare to other Android phones, and it's take some time to detect Fingerprint.2) Rear Camera quality is good but it's not like 48 mega pixels.3) Battery backup is good but its charge slowly.4) Overall performance is good with this price.
"
478,"  Best phone in this price range!Pros1) Camera is best in class. The photos clicked are so great in quality.2) Phone is fast as anything. Even the heaviest of apps open in a jiffy.3) Fingerprint sensor unlocks the phone in less than a second.4) Colour and looks are so pleasant.Cons1) Display is okay, somewhat yellowish.2) Phone is a little bulky and heavy on hand.
"
479,"  I like the focus mode, that helps to keep apps that are needed active to avoid unwanted notifications to distract ones work. Dark mode and eye protection is also good feature that protects eye. Inbuilt Smart mode helps detect the fraud/spam calls without any external app installation. Camera quality is good with good zoom capability. Phone is light and slim with good responsive touch sensor. Overall Phone is very good for my purchase budgetof Rs9500.
"
480,"  It's a great phone from Samsung in budget series. I will not waste your time nor mine.so coming to the point all things are positive so I'm gonna tell you negative fingerprint reader is on the side on power button It's just okay quality. And other thing is cameras are also good but front one is just OK. But overall in this price range it's awesome and if you are confused between redmi 10 and Samsung m12  just go for it.It's just great and above all it's Samsung, 😉
"
481,"  Slighly bigger than M10, M21 amd M31. Other than 6 GB Ram 128 GB storage and 6000 MaH battery, everything is ordinary. They could have given a better screen for this price. Even charging cable is shorter than optimum.
"
482,"  Touchscreen issues, Display issues, Bad Hardware and Delay in Mobile. When brough mobile normal apps looks finme still slow display but few apps like phone pe etc these keys are not matching and responses are slow overal display issues and touchscreen issues are there . unfortunately i installed phone pe and found this issue after return window and now not sure what needs to be done very bad display and touchscreen not worth to buy this mobile. I tried all updates etc within 7/8 days have issues .
"
483,"  Touch is extremely bad and is irritating as it doesn’t recognize and hangs up.Have to lock and unlock several times to get other apps working.When phone is locked, despite double / triple tapping the screen, it doesn’t light up or show option to unlock, we have to press the side button yo light the screen which is more frustrating.Extremely slow even though it’s 4 gb ram
"
484,"  If you are interested in a budget camera phone, this one isn't for you.This phone is pretty smooth. Works for people who don't use phones much like me.Battery life is awesome and I'm enjoying it but cable is a bit short.Overall good phone, would recommend this one if u are really low on budget but if you can spend a bit more, just get the Samsung m30s or m31.This phone just needs improvement in camera and otherwise this is a decent budget phone.
"
485,"  The mobile comes with lots of bloatware. Needs to be trimmed. Also the contact list is not easy to use when a name has more than 1 contact. Most importantly, searching thru various notifications is difficilt. Privacy is at risk because the pictures keep changing everytime one presses the power button to start - which means all our actions are being recorded somewhere.I do not use thw Fingerprint reader but still it is asking to rate. So gave 1 star raring.
"
486,"  The Camera is not good it feels like a 13 MP not 48MP the battery life is normal it will last 1 day easily and will charge the full battery in 3hrs but the phone is heavy more than 2000 grams and I have also tried COD Mobile in medium setting the 90hz refresh rate help in gaming and the overall gaming experience is fine. I would suggest you to go for this phone if you are only a normal user, it is not made for heavy gaming
"
487,"  Average phone at this range, phone gets hanged while using some basic apps. Battery life is ok doesn't seem like 6000mah which makes phone heavy , camera quality is average. Only best thing  about the phone is its look.All together I feel you can get a better phone at this price
"
488,"  i love samsung ab jab redme ke hi parige me samsung mil raha haj to zabardsti ka add wala phone lene ka kya faida samsung lo
"
489,"  This review is after using phone for 1 week.Likes-Under 10k budget  this phone is very good to use, it's having  almost features like a 14-15k phone,camera quality is also good.My usage of phone is more would say whole day so by the EOD I left with 20-30%batteryDislikes-what I was in need of I dint get that is Wifi-calling option in this phone.Main drawback is if battery reaches below 40- 50 it takes really long time to get fully charged up.
"
490,"  I am using this for more than a month as of now ....This is a very good Product at the price which Samsung is selling. It says it is MADE IN INDIA.I really like the Battery Backup for me it is lasting for more than 30 hours with moderate uses. Like ( Youtube ,  calling and Hotspot uses)COns : -It is Bulking and feels heavy in pocketFinger print scanner is not up to the mark .. some times it is unable to unlock .
"
491,"  इस फोन में कई कमियां है जैसे इसकी नोटिफिकेशन ट्यून बंद करने पर भी नोटिफिकेशन आने पर बजती है।इसको चार्ज़िंग पर लगाने और फोन के चार्ज होने का कोई भी संकेत नहीं मिलता है।नोटिफिकेशन से सम्बंधित प्रकाश संकेत इसमे उपलब्ध नहीं है जिससे स्क्रीन लॉक होने पर नोटिफिकेशन की जानकारी नहीं हो पाती है।भार में भी ये अन्य फोनो से काफी ज्यादा है।कैमरा तो चार चार है पर पिक्चर की गुणवत्ता संतोषजनक नहीं है।वाई फाई की रेंज बहुत ही कम है एक दीवार के बाद डाउनलोड की स्पीड अत्यंत कम हो जाती।

493,"  Please dont buy if u r expecting good camera quality in this phone...i mean its below below below average...not at all good...Overall phone is good in this range but expected a lot better from samsung.. this mobile should be sold in 7k not more than that...
"
494,"  It's a complete package at such an attractive price. Blue color looks amazing and camera quality is good. Monster battery of 6000 mAh is good for 2 days of normal use. Overall really happy.

"
498,"   Got struck on the setup screen due to touch is less responsive . Amazon  seller had delivered a malfuncted phone to me.Disappointed by Amazon atleast you should do quality check for the product your selling. Complete waste of time and waste of money.If there is option for negative star I will definitely give that also.Disappointed
"
499,"  Camera ia average, but for decent activity this is really a good buy. Current 6gb varient is available for 10500 after applying offers is a great deal you can definitely buy it. But not for heavy users.
"
500,"  I ordered this product on 20 July 2021 and immediately it got delivered within a week on 29 July 2021.Mobile camera is good.Battery is betterPerformance and storage is goodOverall it's good mobile for normal android usersThis review is not for  users who play high end games (like ping, free fire etc) in mobile
"
501,"  First impressions:Pros : 2 days battery life if internet is used constantly.RAM is enough to handle the heavy apps smoothly.Runs on latest Android version and Samsung UI.Cons:So so camera quality as compared to similar price range products.
"
502,"  Overall in this budget the phone is ok.Primary camera is good, but doesn't seems to be true 48 mp. If you're a selfie lover then dont buy this phone, because the front camera is worst.Decent battery life, can lasts upto 1 and a half day with average use.Processor saw some improvements, asphalt 9 and call of duty is running alright but not smooth. 90 mhz screen is a pure lie by the samsung, the TFT display is poorly managed on the hardware. Fast charging is there.
"
503,"  I am so glad to say you that phone was delivered at fully boxed and wrapped around phone.As I using phone, the battery performing above my expectations.Camera is taking stunning pictures as I wish.Fingerprint sensor are working good but not like other.Screen touch also as smooth as the velvet touch.Phone is working at awesome speedy.
"
504,"  Mic Quality in video is extremely bad. Cannot explain how bad it is... I ordered 2 phones at my home... both of them have this same issue. Samsung needs to address this immediately. I don't want to talk about other features as this is budget phones. But never seen such a bad quality from this or lower price range.
"
505,"  Nothing extra ordinary about this phone. There are much better options in this price range.The battery is definitely good, and lasts more than a full day.However on the down side, the phone is very heavy, camera is ordinary and it feels sluggish to use.
"
506,"  For this price, it is a good phone. Bit heavy but battery life is good so can't complain there. Camera is okay.. not so great. If you are looking for a good camera then u might not want this phone. Rest it is a good phone.
"
507,"  3 months use review - no voice recording tool, no screen video capture tool, it's usually available on any cheap phone. Samsung says these are available on higher end models, who is a snob?Given 3 stars overall just because of the plastic at the back, during the call it vibrates  cheap plastic casing otherwise phone works fine. Other phones cheaper than this have better casing but then....
"
508,"  got this ph @9999 in offer. the touch, sensor are really bad. especially face recognition, which never recognizes me.application opening, processor speed with min 5 applications and battery life are good
"
509,"  It feels good in hand.Screen is not very impressive  as advertised.Battery life is good.Main Camera is average. Front camera is good.It is easily handling both my personal and work environments. I don't see any lag.Over all, it is a very good purchase at this price.PS : not able to find a good back cover as most of the available ones are manufactured for galaxy A12. They fits to M12 but feels like not perfect.
"
510,"  This phone is having all good features and it's finger print reader and face recognizing is working super.Sound and battery  life is goodCamera superAnd all other phone feature are compare to 30k+ ir provided in thisA big thanks to Samsung...loving it.
"
511,"  Display is HD+ with TFT panel but it doesn't feel like TFT rather it feels IPS LCD HD+ panel! Good move Samsung! But other brands providing IPS LCD FHD+ 90hz in this 12k segment from Other brands! But initially it's good.
"
512,"  1 month since I bought it, excellent all rounder. Great performance, fast, nice camera for d price.Battery is too good, easily lasts 2 days with medium usage.I don't play games, so can't comment on Game performance.Camera is not d best, but for this price, I didn't expect much. Daylight pictures are really great. Video quality is also good.
"
513,"  Mobile is nice5 star in Battery Life5 star in other specs4 star in camera3.5 star in optimization.The optimization is bad due to OneUI. Samsung hasn't made a good UI. It is not optimised. The camera is better,but it don't have more modes while it's competitor Redmi 9 Power have nice camera modes. This mobile is best in all types just the Camera and OneUI is not good
"
514,"  I used in and really the feelings was great. It is smooth no hang or down occours. Storage and new camera facility was just good and little bit mora upgarde to the camera needed I think 'Slow motion operation '. Over experience was great. You all have to try it once. For gamers it may little not good as the processor is getting some lapse while using heavy games.My experience was best because with this amount the mobile provides a lot.
"
515,"  At this price, I expect atleast a little better phone. First of all, the processor is slow and lagging. The camera quality is very bad. I mean ""very"" bad so think about what are the essential things you definitely need before buying. Battery life is fine. Look is average because its quite thick than other models. Overall, I think its okay for general purposes but not a good phone to have.
"
516,"  I bought the phone yesterday. There is a problem with the display and image quality view in this phone. Images appers yellowish and dull. I am thinking of returing the phone.
"
517,"  I think this product is not bad. Those who don't want to take a lot of selfi but want to use Phone for call, to listen music and to watch videos - they can try this M12 .Yes Phone looks slightly heavy but overall good in this price range
"
518,"  I have purchased a samsung M12 mobile and 6 months free screen replacement warranty added for prime member at that I am also prime member so this benefit added.After 2 week mobile was Fall down and screen was damaged.So I went to samsung service center and claim the warranty but my mobile insurance plan was not activated so you will be bay and change the screen.Last 25 days I am try to activate my plan but problem was solved upto date.So please solve the problem quickly
"
519,"  Bad in charging ( not a fast charging  phone take 4 to5 hours for charging)Also battery back is not good enough  drained in 8 hours similar as my earlier  phone .Screen display also not up to mark. ( pixels  are average)Sound quality  in both speakers is bad ( voice clarity  not good)Also phone is slow while operating ( taking pause while using)There are  good option other brands at similar  prices
"
520,"  I always think 10times before I order anything expensive from Amazon because I have got a bad product. But this time dont know why I didn't give a thought. This model of Samsung M12 was available in Amazon only and guess what I received manufacturing defective piece. Seems like Amazon is pleasing customers by making things available in advance which turn out to be defective. Samsung also does not take responsibility of replaceling their defective piece with a new one.
"
521,"  There is a Bluetooth connectivity issue in Samsung M12 mobile and it also not supports 5G. Big drawback for this product. I never expected from Samsung that this type of issue will come with phone. I don't know why bluetooth is not supporting to all device. Please provide the Bluetooth connectivity solutions.
"
522,"  Haven't used it for too long but from the current usage these are the observations1. Battery life is good,  used it to stream movies and music but still worked out fine.2. Camera is ok, again based on specs for the price range.3. Would have liked better packaging and a back cover atleast.
"
523,"  Brought this phone in Apr 2021 , kept it for charging when the battery was down and after after hours the display was gone . Don’t suggest anyone to buy this phone .
"
524,"  I've been using this for some days now and I have to say it's been great. The phone is really sleek and screen resolution is very good. Camera is excellent in Good lighting... Under poor light or night time it may not do so well. Phone is really beautiful though.
"
525,"  6Gb,128 GB phone was much slow than my old phone of 2Gb, 32Gb.Don't go by specifications only, performance not matching for this model.Thanks to Amazon for returning the product.

527,"                
"
528,"   Gaming wise very poor
"
529,"  Uhh...the fingerprint scanner is good but i am not a fan of side mounted fingerprint scanner....so thats why the 4 stars... otherwise, everything is fine looking at the price.... though the phone is a bit heavy and bulkier than my other phones.
"
530,"  Overall it's the best phone for the price range. Battery life is a blast, sometimes I can go without charging for 2 days on a 2-3 hour screen time. If you start the day at 100, after heavy use you will still be left with the battery at the end of the day.The camera is pretty good too, but not great. I'd say a 4/5 for the camera.The phone is kinda heavy if you are not used to heavy phones then take care for the first 1-2 weeks.
"
531,"  At this cost, this phone is awesome. Camera, Screen, Battery everything is awesome. However, on careful inspection some sensors are missing when compared to Xiaomi and other Chinese brands.
"
532,"  There is no option for WIFI 5.0 Ghz in this phone. Now-a-days almost all of us have dual band Wifi router in our homes/offices. But this phone will only work with lower speed and lower bandwidth 2.4 Ghz. It cannot detect the higher bandwidth 5.0 Ghz, so you won't get higher Wifi speed
"
533,"  Pros..Battery stays more than a day at a full recharge.. (Usage : medium)New sensors for motion gestures..Viewing angles nice.Camera - decentCons:Slightly thicker nd weigher..After two days it wasn't noticeable...Verdict: Go for it..
"
534,"  Worst UI experience from samsung.1. Basic app lock setting missing.2. Data disconnected while in a call.3. While using Amazon custome care chat keyboard hide the typed content.4. SMS selects the recent caller option missing.5. You can't off the alarm for one particular day. You have to off then on the alarm again.5. Unnecessary samsung apps occupy the space which you not even open in your lifetime.
"
535,"  Since, my colleague is using this phone for the past 20 days, he is extremely satisfied with the product (be its battery life, camera quality or display). The thing which he miss is the Samsung Earphone/headphones which should have been provided with it (thus cutting one star for this). Else everything is okay.
"
536,"  A phone working good with all app except high end gaming app or some high processor occupied apps. Phone get switched off automatically on high processor usage when multi app functioning. Good at 8.5k price.Camera quality very good without zoom. Very bad with full zoom. Same with selfi cam.Networking : zero problems till now.Rest is good till now in last 1 month from i bought.
"
537,"  Good bettry life so mobile is bit heavy.Not a best camara but fine in this range and its not 48MP totally fake.Overall good for parents who needs bettry life and not photoholic.

538,"  Fingerprint reader not worked properlyIf you unlock  you device 10 times its perfectly  work only 6 times*PHONE PAY* GOOGLE  PAY * NOT WORKING IN THIS DEVICE ,WHEN YOU ENTER  PASSWORD  ITS OVERLAPPED, YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO SEE WHAT ARE YOU ENTEREDI PURCHASE M12 IN APPROX 25 SEPTEMBER  AND WITH IN 2 WEEKS PRICE DOWN BY 2000RS ,ITS SHOWS THAT PRODUCT IS TOTALLY  FLOPED NOW SAMSUNG  JUST CLEARED THE STOCK.

"
540,"  I had purchased M31 and wanted to get a second phone, so got this.Latest OS , Good RAM and internal storage,disappointing  its released in Feb-2021, but didn't provide a 5 ghz WLAN connectivity (my mistake based on M31 thought this will also be available based on release date), also the Network signal gets lost very often.Though it can be expanded to 1TB, would recommend spend an additional INR 4-5K and get M31.Couldn't return.
"
541,"  Very poor quality phone. Camera and display quality is very poor. Poor than even 2 mega pixels camera.Display quality is worsed . Totally use less product.Doesn't meet any quality as advertised by samsung. .I don't want to give even 1 star to this phone.This is worst product of samsung.I want to return this phone.Amazon please return this phone
"
542,"  Complete package, truly it's a Monster Reloaded. Everything from Camera to Speed to Interface is perfect. Only negative thing is that it's bit thick & heavy. It's a Made in India Product.
"
543,"  Light weight, lovely colour.UI is good.Camera settings had to be changed as the default picture quality was set to 5MP. After a software update, I could change it to the right MP.

545,"  Within six months its dead, never ever buy samsung mobile, sorry I never expected this from samsung, it's rebooted again and again, all please avoid samsung they didn't do R&D properly
"
546,"  Their is no negative rating option, so i have to give 1 rating to this junk phone.  DON'T BUY this device, after 5 day only its screen become blank tried all possible trouble shooting available online, but this junk phone didn't recover. Finally i have to go to service centre and from their also pathetic response i have to visit 3 different service centre to get this repair. Didn't except such a pathetic product from Samsung.
"
547,"  Nice product! I like it so much, battery life is too good I do not drain more the 50% of battery after heavy usage. Camera quality is good, processor is so amazing for day to day usage, fingerprint works pretty well, charing speed is normal. Overall, nice product for day to day usage. And thanks flipkart for so delivery very! I ordered it on 18/03/2021 and get it one 20/03/2021! Thanks flipkart again for fast delivery and a value for money and budget phone in only 11,000 rupees
"
548,"  The fingerprint sensor is very fast... 90hz display quality is good smooth touch and nice colour production. Battery backup is awesome can play games specially PUBG in HD  easily without lag ,but the portrait sensor is not so impressive, it's just somewhat good. 48mp and other lenses are also awesome ,they capture really impressive images....Overall the mobile is very good . If you have lower budget and about a trustworthy brand , then go for it.
"
549,"  Even YouTube videos are running screen getting turned off automatically and sound goes normal. This problem is happening unevenly. I have used very gently as it new device and I facing this problem. Please don't waste your money here .be careful with what you are getting
"
550,"  100% battery charging takes 3hrs of time were slow changing but the battery life is wow it's super, camera quality is super it's just been 3days if any other issues I will update my review in future.
"
551,"  So impressed with the battery backup, and display is good with a great refresh rate, value for money product, that too in a great price. Using this phone along with my S21 Ultra,but still i love this.
"
552,"  Battery backup super,Camera quality well... But the macro option worst... Selfi just low quality..Processing speed good...some specification are like to 6000rs mobile phone...Face lock, fingerprint lock are very quickly working...Overall it is monster...
"
553,"  Best mobile
"
554,"  Except WiFi network connectivity, others things are good.This phone & other company phone kept side by side for testing WiFi signal catch,,,,,,, other company phone WiFi signal connect very fast all time........... but this Samsung M12 failed maximum & maximum & maximum time to catch WiFi signalVery much disappointed with Samsung M12 ☹️☹️☹️☹️
"
555,"  Amazon didn't allow to write a review until they sold most of the stock, something very fishy.Heating problem. It doesn't work with 5.0GHz WiFi frequency. 2.4GHz is very old school.Camera quality is pathetic (both front and back). Forget about 48MP, pictures are all blur, poorer than a 4MP one.
"
556,"  घण्टा true 48 megapixel कैमरा है !!!🔔🔔🔔🔔कैमरे की क्वालिटी 2G के समय जो चाइना फोन आते थे उसके 2 mp के जैसी है ।फोन में दमदार बैटरी के अलावा कुछ भी नही है ।इस प्राइस रेंज में दूसरे मोबाइल इससे ज्यादा फीचर और अच्छी क्वालिटी में मिल जाते है ।पता नही क्यो अमेज़ॉन कस्टमर रिव्यू में ज्यादातर लोगों ने 1 स्टार दिया है फिर भी अमेज़न इसको ओवरऑल 4.5 स्टार क्यो दिखाता है !!
"
557,"  The mobile is good. When the users switches on the mobile for the first time. it finds it too hard to answer all the preloaded questions or confusions.I ordered the mobile , I am going to use the mobile and the additional apps choices should be mine. Numerous un-necessary additional apps are preloaded. I was forced to un-install all the additional apps that was preloaded un-necessarily.
"
558,"  Very Horrible Camera , was totally disappointed with the camera , very poor camera and bad service by Amazon. which made my life miserable in exchanging this product. I have bought many mobiles earlier and now i will not buy from this site as exchange replacement is very difficult.
"
559,"  Think twice before you buy the same. Redmi/Realme phones offers much better specs in this price bracket.Samsung mobile having Exynos processor is known for its lagging performance when compared with those having much lower spec SnapDragon processors. Here same case with M12 also.The only reason for which I recommend M12 is, It comes with Android 11 out of the box and latest One UI also it's built quality.
"
560,"  within 5 months of purchasing there is voice issues in mobile. Not able to hear talk from other side suddenly and need to switch off and on mobile frequently, after switching on the mobile there wont be any voice issues for couple of hours but again the issue will arise after some time, after restarting the device, again for some this issue will get resolved. Currently restarting the device min for 10 times in a day.
"
561,"  Wonderful purchase. I got it for 9499. Amazing budget phone, camera is decent and touch sensitivity is good. Battery life is good but it starts to slow down with usage.There is not lagging yet. Fingerprint is prompt in action, but they need to work on the face unlock.If you have a normal usage, with no gaming, this phone is for you. Its a steal deal!!!
"
562,"  The phone is good.Best for daily use, but if you will play heavy games you may face problem.Camera and built quality is also good.The main problem is with the delivery,The phone was broken and when I complained about it they said we can not do anything,Now I am using a broken phone without any of my fault.0 Star for Amazon!!!If you want to buy any product online don't consider Amazon.
"
563,"  It's very prior to review because I got it one week before. But, I fully satisfied with Samsung galaxy M12. I am Very Happy for this purchase. This was value for money deal for me.  Thank you Amazon 😊💓☺💗💛💖😊💓Thank you Samsung 😊💓☺💗💛💖😊💓☺💗
"
564,"  Go for this if you want samsung brand and trust.Don't waste your money on chinese phones, samsung nis far better than other brands..Also In this you will get One UI core version but samsung doing amazing job with it's UI and implementation..Battery life is awesome..Recommended phone..
"
565,"  camera quality is very poor and we cannot watch videos in HD(1080) quality.. and upto the mark..
"
566,"  FINGERPRINT SENSOR IS REALLY GOOD IT READS AND UNLOCKS IN LESS THAN A SECOND AND THE PROCESSOR USED HERE IS AS EQUIVALENT TO SNAPDRAGON 662 , 660 SOMEWHEREIF YOU ARE PLAYING PUBG IT GIVES HD+HIGH ,SMOOTH + ULTRA ,OVERALL THIS PHONE IS GOOD FOR DAILY USAGE AND GAMING BUT IT HAS A 8MP POOR FRONT CAMERA SENSOR IF YOU DONT USE YOUR CAMERA MUCH THIS PHONE IS FOR YOU !
"
567,"  Received the phone on time as promised. The battery backup is just fabulous - 6000 mAh definitely the power backup requirement that every phone needs. Easy to use phone, but some apps are pre loaded which can be deleted if not using. But definitely way ahead than all the other chinese brands. With 6Gb RAM, using the phone is as smooth as silk. I would recommend this phone with the 6GB / 128GB config to others.
"
568,"  Samsung is really worst company.many time I unable to receive the phone calls.I will never buy Samsung phones anymore. I don't know why they forcefully added their apps in the phone and you can't remove them.
"
569,"  I bought this mobile for my mothershe doesnt use much apps , mostly Youtube, insta, wastapp, music , facebook.Cant comment how this mobile performs for GamesOveral nice looking , robust mobile, good processor, camera is also good, charging last upto 2days normal usage
"
570,"  Fingerprint scanner is too slowTouchscreen doesn't respond 5/10 timesNeed to long press many times to get responseNetwork issue..This is review after using this phone for 5 days.Totally disappointed.
"
571,"  Bought the Samsung M12. Good purchase. Worth the price.Likes:1. Exceptional Battery backup2. Fast processing for Game Play3. Good Display clarity4. Very responsive Biometric sensors, especially Face RecognitionNot so Good Camera clarity especially during night time in artifical light. Also, the speaker sound could have been louder.
"
572,"  I bought the phone the 6GB ram version and have been using it for three days now. Tge functions are smooth and the camera and screesize are great for the prize. It also gets fully charged in an hour. Will review again after a few more days. Can accomodate 2 sim cards plus a sd card simultaneously. Also the finish as the back is textured and matte, not glossy like it seems in the pictures.
"
573,"  If you expect to use WIFI in 5GHz band at home , then Dont go for it; it supports only 2.4 GHz.  Really disappointed after got to know this. it was not highlighted specifically in the retail sites, info is available in Samsung site only.You cant full enjoy an internet speed at home, even if you have 5GHz band router
"
574,"  It is written that""Whats in the box Handset, Ejection Pin, Manual, Data Cable and Travel Adaptor""I received only Mobile, Data Cable & Adaptor there is no handset Ejection pin manual warranty card and proper bill
"
575,"  It's amazing!! It's really a monster reloaded version...works amazingly! Even the Amazon service was nice....it was not damaged when delivered..I has all new features...and is very satisfactory..just how android users need.. camera is nice too..n specially the cover it has got...is very grippy...the phn doesn't slip from hands😅
"
576,"  Grt product at this price, bank offer also applied.Camera rating 2 starDisplay 2 starBattery & Performance 5 star.Over all good product at this price.
"
577,"  A sturdy phone with good battery and storage for rough and tough use. Camera is good with good quality front and back cameras. The 6.5"" dimension is very good for viewing videos. This at an affordable price makes it a paisa vasool mobile.
"
578,"  I have bought this phone for my cousin, whenever he is editing videos or playing new indian version of pubg, phone is getting hang very much.Otherwise phone for normal use is good, not good for video editting and game lovers.
"
579,"  Not much impressed with this product for this price.. Mobile is very bulky and fingerprint sensor is not much handy. Photo quality is just okay when I compare with redmi y3.
"
580,"  Everything is very good som people said processor is not good but it's absolutely very epic it can handle any task also I didn't use it for gamingoyher than that video editing is great and battery can stand upto 2days if not use very hardly, it has a great battery , camera is fabulous also galaxy apps give u boost in every way hence this phone is very fabulous under 10K, Hence Proved.
"
581,"  Camera Quality is great with good processing speed and classy features. Only limitation is with the 5 GHz wifi connection. It only connects to 2.4 GHz wifi network.
"
582,"  sometimes it lags camera quality is very good but not excellent compared to other phones in 20-30k range despite it having 4 cameras and battery life is good but for a 6000mah battery it shouldve had more battery life and it lags sometimes when calling and stuff overall a good device for the price got it for 8.5k on amazon
"
583,"  The mobile takes around 4 hours, and gets drained out in 2-3  hours (ONLY WiFi enable and NO GPS, NO Wif-Calling, NO Hotspot, NO Hotspot, NO Bluetooth) without any usage.Further, the Amazon replacement process is too lengthy and bad. You'll have to go through a technician home visit in the process.
"
584,"  M12 build is good. Handset is little bit heavy. Camera quality is 50:50. Battery life is awesome. With Android 11 browsing is faster. Fingerprint on right side works well.
"
585,"  Phone is just okay similar to m30, m31s. However this phone misses to have dual band wifi. Supports only 2.5 Ghz wifi band limiting the wifi speed. Unable to make of 5Ghz wifi for higher speed.
"
586,"  * good proc* not heating much* fast* good storage* not slow after 2 months of usage (with a lot of old / transferred data and apps)* value for money* good sound (not great, but good)
"
587,"  very poor quality display
"
588,"  The new samsung m12 is really amazing,Has a side fingerprint reader and battery quality is good.The product was delivered early with proper care.The display is good and samsung has introduced a few new quirks into the UIVery good phone for the budget.
"
589,"  Battery  Performance  Long Lasting  But It Takes More Than Two & Half Hour To Complete Charge  So There  Is Nothing Like Fast Charging  (think self 15w charger for 6000mah battery) Camera Quality Poor As They Call It 48 Megapixel Camera But Actually It Don't Take Proper Zooming Shots (more u can guess self) And Rest All Features Are Best As My Own Understanding For Such Budget .
"
590,"  Real battery monster, good RAM & processor performance. At this budget, getting these 2 key features is a great deal. Camera quality may not be satisfactory but overall the phone is great. We cannot expect all top features at this price. Still the phone is a great product at this price.
"
591,"  Good value for money. Bought it for my parents. Screen is large, so easy for them to use. However Samsung should think of making it lighter. Good build quality, good camera.
"
592,"  The touch is awfully unresponsive..Ys without any protective glass, which fails as a touch device in the first place..in these days of loaded cameras, this is kind of ok. so is the battery. Samsung doesn't promise much on display but the bothersome unresponsive touch is a big downfall which overrides everything else about the phone.
"
593,"  Phone touch is smooth doesn't hang and heat battery life is best and charges fast problem with this phone is camera quality they say it's 48mp but it feels like 13mp fingerprint sensor onside is very inconvenient they must have placed it on the back and the phone is very heavy
"
594,"  Worst product from Samsung ibreally did not expect this from samsung and I really had more expectations about this productMore over this phone says 90 hz display bit it hangs a lot and it's like using a fake 3 class phone.I do not want the other customers to fall for the Advitisment of this device which is a total scam I would like to says people be careful and don't be a victim to this phone
"
595,"  Review Summary: I bought two Samsung phone and both have below cons. A21- Rs 18000, M12-10500Dislike: Charging Speed too low, Camera is very bad. Phone is quite slow as compared to other rivalary phone. Too heavy. In short Phone is very costly as compared to its features. Touch screen is also not so fast. Sometimes it doesnt work.Samsung seriously need to work on the above problems.
"
596,"  Initially when I purchased I had a problem with it's speaker after the instructions followed for fixing now the device is overheating while charging , also when I'm using for even small applications like Google meet its not even a heavy application like COD . I advise you to not buy this device it has so many issues like this, Worst experience ever and it's only been a month since I have purchased it from Amazon.
"
597,"  The worst mobile I have bought from samsung. I have been a premium samsung customer in past where I haven't faced any issues. But for this model, by day 16 the display is not seen and I can't replace the mobile even in Amazon and also in samsung. The battery is getting heated up. I suggest not to buy this model because I have an issue in camera which I have replaced and faced the above issue with the second buy.
"
598,"  This phone was gifted by me and the user of the phone has the following complain. she is been using it for 15 days now.1.Sometime the dialing just stops and it hangs for a while.2. Sometime u cannot disconnect the call.3. In a span of 15 days the phone has hanged for 4 times4. I feel there is a software issue.5. there are few small problems while using the phone but cannot explain.
"
599,"  Battery is pathetic.  It's not 6000 mh battery. it drains very fast. Phone is ok for 10000 budget. Samsung quality has dropped.  Earlier Samsung phone had a superb quality.People buying this phone can go ahead. Good phone only battery  draining fast.I am using vivo y12. It's 5000 mh battery  but it last more than M12.
"
600,"  Samsung offered great features in this price range but the performance is not as it may seem. Back camera is good, but front camera image quality reminded of starting phone camera (blurry). Fingerprint reader does not work many times. Surprisingly this new phone also hangs sometimes. Still it is usable considering its price. You can consider MI to Samsung in this price range
"
601,"  Good about product- battery  is superb- camera is Ok Ok not so good as expected from 48MP camera- easy to operateNegatives- processing is concern , very slow response of touch , even my three years led phone give better touch response- hindi typing is tedious process which must be easy like other phones- charging time is 3 hours so not so quick
"
602,"  Phone is quite heavy in weight. Fingerprint sesnsor is fast. Camera quality is not as good as expected. UI is smooth. Back panel looks good. Battery is good. As the headphone jack is in the lower part of the panel, you can't keep the phone in upright position when the headphone is plugged in.
"
603,"  Loved this phone, especially battery life is amazing,  I can easily go without charging for 2 days. I m not a heavy user though I play CoD once a day and response is good, doesn't lag at all. Happy with this buy, full value for money.Con: Camera could have been better, just that I have seen better photos with lesser specs
"
604,"  Not bad for my needs as I'm not a PUBG fanboy... good for elderly people.. go for Galaxy F22(G80) or M21-2021(Exy9611) if you're looking for a better gaming XP.. Camera suffers in low light but pretty solid in daylight.. Software is well optimised unlike Mi and Realme.. Quite a bit overpriced..Not Bad but certainly not the Best.. Galaxy F22 has better XP.. M03s has better Value
"
605,"  Interior product with very bad quality body material. Not charging and battery is getting heating.Very much unsatisfied with Amazon to list such a bad quality product, selling no support being provided after sell.Also I loosed trust on Samsung. Hard to believe such big brand reputed company ditching customer by providing worst quality product.
"
606,"  I bought this for my mother who uses for basic calls and youtube. Not for moderate or heavy users. It will be a good option if calls and little bit of social media are the only things you use on phone.
"
607,"  Purchased the device 2 months back, Now Mobile Display was not showing and when shown to the service center they won't cover the display under warrenty, they charged us for the display.Device display causing the issue because of high capacity battery and mobile heating issue
"
608,"  This is an amazing product, the ram is really fast and it's battery life is just amazing, I am really happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend this. The cameras are amazing and I'm super happy with the front camera as well. The scrolling feels so smooth and the wide screen is a good feature.  Overall I'm really happy with this, definitely an upgrade from my old Redmi Note 4!
"
609,"  I used this mobile ofter 1 week iam giving reviewFinger print sensor is above 3 starScreen is above 3 starCharging and battery is well-done 5 starCamera is just ok above 2 starMobile  working just fine like 4 gb ram it's not working like 6 gbAnd I will say finally go for another mobile it is only 4g mobile. Even 5g wifi is not connect this mobile genaration is going fast
"
610,"  Phone seems looks good but getting stuck when we browsing, while using calls and using camera. So I recommend do not choose samsung at all. Go for better company where reasonable prices applicable.
"
611,"  ✅ Solid build quality from Samsung as always. Feels bit premium due to the textured and smudge proof back panel.✅ Amazing display @4k 60fps 90Hz✅ Responsive side fingerprint sensor.✅ Average camera, but good in budget.✅ Made in SAMSUNG, Noida Plant, INDIA. Don't have to worry about giving your hard earned money to CCP controlled companies.
"
612,"  Product supplied was having damage. Images and videos arr not having clarity as them appeared to be blurred like negative film of old photograpphy. Black surface is appeared to be white and white appeared to be black. Even the images and videos downloaded from internet are found to be not visible and having no clarity. Also the photos taken in photone are having no visibility. So i placed return request.
"
613,"  Not satisfied,as told in products reviews told at The time of saleNot a Fast changing as mentioned. Got heated while charging, product value questions your brand- Samsung. M12 series, Even not listed in your own brand list for exchange options, why it so?
"
614,"  Camera is the best of all without a doubt. Device is very smooth and it can be used 2 days or more if you don't use heavily.I am a heavy user with lots of phone calls and heavy using of youtube. Phone is heavy because of it's massive 6000 mah battery. Every thing is fine if you don't play heavy games we can play games under 400mb smoothly.Smooth device writing this after 2 months of usage loving it. 🔥😍
"
615,"  Writing this review after 2-3 months of using it. Phone is sturdy & battery life is superb.Finger print sensor & Face recognition needs improvement. Sound is excellent.Camera is as per the best quality.
"
616,"  Camera quality is not as expected,  we can consider a low budget phone. Finger print reader doesnt works some times. Battery backup is great, built quality is nice.
"
617,"  I have been facing issue of wifi connectivity post software updates. I have asked for replacement phone still same issue now waiting for refund.Not sure about issue of connectivity but i have faced on two similar phones model
"
618,"  This budget mobile is very good. No heating, no hanging, no slacking. Fast browsing, sound is good.  Handling  very easy. batter back up very  high, finger print reader stylish & nice, camera quality  good.
"
619,"  Never been a fan of Side finger print, so no points here. Battery life is definitely good. Camera and sound are both just average, nothing more. I'm sure, had i broadened my horizon, there are better products to choose from in this price range.
"
620,"  Samsung M12 mobile is excellent for low budget. Camera, Battery Backup, Display & Sound quality is too much good. So I recommend to all viewers go & purchase this mobile without any doubt & hesitation. Thanks  Samsung to bring this product for middle class peoples. My choice is all to use Samsung because it's operating system is very easy to any user.Regards,Khilaban Kumar Das
"
621,"  The mobile lacks in some of the basic features. Screen capture is a problem and other gunctionalities. You can't set a clock as screen saver. I feel the basic features that doesn't involve costs should be made available
"
622,"  Samsung is providing better phone now but this m12 is less than average. Average display, average battery and charging. U can buy it for your father or mother, means who don't use it more would love to buy it.
"
623,"  Bought it as my talking device because of its huge battery capacity. It is a secondary device and I love it. If you’re looking for a simple device at best price I would surely recommend it.
"
624,"  Very good phone with a nice battery. The camera quality is up to the mark According to the price. The fingerprint sensor also works very Smoothly. The display is also good but you can't really find the difference from 60hz to 90hz. Although the phone is good for its price but in the box you  don't get a cover, pre applied screen protector and a short USB cable.
"
625,"  Awesome mobile in this price segment. Battery is big for 1 1/2 day. Rear camera is also good.
"
626,"  In this range.. 8nm processor & with thebrand of Samsung... Ossummm.. after 3 months of use this product i recommend u all that buy it if u want mobile phone in this range.. network speed is also bestest because of 8nm processor.. all the best
"
627,"  Camera quality is below par than the 12MP old phones. Poor Customer service. No call recórding option, No ultra power saving mode. Never buy Samsung phones it's last its quality. Attached photos for reference. Samsung blaming Amazon saying they provided the defect piece to me. Efficient authorised service provider finding is also headache in this pandemic situation. BETTER NOT TO BUY THIS PRODUCT.
"
628,"  No any help option on Amazon for warranty replacement display. If 6 month screen replacement warranty from amazon side so how is the process.bcz no any replacement option.no any contect number amazon customer care for help..very bad service.6 month warranty only provide from amazon.no warranty from samsung.samsung service center told give me 3600 RS for  display replacement charges. So what I do..
"
629,"  I got the product seems used by some one, there are finger print in the mobile phone screen, also the bill found in two piece, already tored by someone
"
630,"                    The media could not be loaded.
"
631,"                
"
632,"   Very good packaging, delivery and excellent phone. The phone has a very good battery life and the camera is very good and takes excellent photos. It's a decent phone very fit for this price range. It's worth buying, worth the price.
"
633,"  Taught this phone is really very good and purchased face tec issue net work was not at  all capturing completely phone was very sloe compare to my previous one... Tec guy visited finally noting happned because phone had issue and got a replacement for new 1but was surprised beacuse the second 1is worster then before... Am really very upset almost 2weeks without a a phone is not at all acceptable
"
634,"  Very good purchase.Excellent battery life better than Galaxy 31s model.All the features are good except camera.Very happy with the purchase of this phone.
"
635,"  Perfect value phone. Has everything that one requires. For the price it is more than value It is a little heavy compares to others but not a deal breaker.. perfect for gifting to parents...
"
636,"  There is a software problem, whenever you make a call for the 1st time the speaker is not activated and so you can't hear anything the person on the other side is speaking. But if you disconnect it and call again it works fine. Initially i thought its network issue but later i realised it happens every time i try to make i call after a considerable time gap like an hour or so.
"
637,"  I got this for 11,499 which was a great deal for 6gb ram and 128 gb memory.
"
638,"  Phone camera is not worth the quality mentioned and the device is also having more weight... Rethink if you want to buy this... Not sure why amazon removed return policy it's better to check phone locally in shop and buy
"
639,"  I don't use mobile for heavy-duty stuff.From my regular use for a month now I can tell that there have been No hangs. Hence a great improvement over my previous phone back is non-slippery and hence fewer chances of mobile damage, pretty good for clumsy guy like me
"
640,"  Don't go for exchenge, it's a trip. They are expecting a brand new device which you could exchange. The intention of the Amazon delivery boy is like to found anything wrong in device and the price will deduct 70% to 80% from its original exchange ammount even it is well running. The attitude of the Amazon delivery boy is too rough and tough. It's my second horrible experience from Amazon end.
"
641,"  Camera quality is not at par. Samsung also doing as china. Shown 48 megapixel camera, but in-fact it may lower than 5 megapixel only.Samsung have to do something
"
642,"  Very wrost experience this time.Touch is not working sometime.geasture is not working sometime.camara taking too much time to saving image after taking picture.mic problem when you make video call.
"
643,"  Phone auto restarts at times.. touch capabilities are not that great, everything you have to ensure that your hands are completely dry. Even with a minute moisture on your fingers, phone gives you improper response
"
644,"  Speed is OK for working, since it is 6 GB RAM. Battery is very good. Display is  also, OK. For doing normal data processing work lime share trading, for using excel, Word.., small types of editing,  ...., this system is enough, but if you intend shooting , its not enough.  Camera is not seems 48 MP. Front camera is OK.
"
645,"  It's amazing product from samsung.i congrats to Samsung engineer but one mild issues affect this mobile heat issue at the same it is not continue otherwise only charging time it might be heat slightly.Very low budgetCamera okTouch okModel okUsing very comfortableBattery heating is slightly negative so I give four 🌟 and with out battery issue I give 5 🌟
"
646,"  Most disappointing thing is it's camera quality.It's 48mp camalera is not worthy. It does not match with Nokia's 13 MP camera.I purchase it for camera purpose but it does not fulfill my requirement. Camera quality is very poor.Though display is quite decent, battery life is normal functioning is smooth.If you are looking a mobile phone for camera then never buy it.
"
647,"  Samsung really needs to stop fooling customers with its marketing and needs to improve its products to compete other brands. This new samsung m12 is a piece of crap and wastage of money. The sound is too low. If the phone is ringing, you can't hear even if you are sitting next to it. The design is okay. No new or nothing very impressive. Copied the F12 in terms of design
"
648,"  screen broken. amazon claims that there is one time free screen replacement warrantee for Prime. i am not able to claim warrantee. product support section of amazon is not working.
"
649,"  + PointsGood Budget Phone.Good DisplayGood Outlook- PointsToo heavy, due to big battery.The camera is not that effective.Takes longer to charge
"
650,"  Fingerprint senser is not so sensitive. One has to put his/her finger very tightly.Battery charges slow since it supports 15 watt charger. It drains faster if adaptive motion is set to 90 hz.Camera quality is decent but it should be improved. In 48 mp mode flash will not work.It's backlight remains always on due to which processor is heated.Speakers are very slow.
"
651,"  After gaining experience by using it at least 3 months then correct answer will come. How can I give 5 out of 5 within a month. Thanks for your cooperation.
"
652,"  I already have one Samsung M20. After buying this new M12, I installed Samsung smart switch on both phones. It  transferred all data except messages in thousands. I raised request with Samsung. They clarified it is software bug and update would be provided within 24 Hrs. It's third day, no update is received. I am returning new M12 phone.
"
653,"  Brought this mobile on March 30. I am not satisfied with this mobile. It's getting heat when we use it for the normal phone calls without internet as well. When i checked with Samsung service center they said that if the mobile heat goes beyond 48°C then they can look into it. Not sure who will be able to withstand this mobile heat when they are talking. Pls don't buy.
"
654,"  I am using this product since last 1 month. The display is nice..... HD+ display but colour contrast is amazing. The battery last upto 36 hours with normal use.Camera is good for captureing pictures day light. It's 90hz disply is awsome.This smartphone is NOT FOR GAMING.There is slight lag while using heavy apps.Otherwise it's a good budget phone........... 👍👍
"
655,"  I am the user  of only Samsung.  Compared to other models that I have been using till date , this model doesn't satisfy me. The signal strength is low compared to other brands in this price and specifications.Overall I am not satisfied with this model.
"
656,"  seems a seconds phone like factory reject or a repaired version like refurbished maybe,it's bent,the screen can't be covered with tempered glass as the phone is curved.
"
657,"  a good phone at this cost.fingerprint and face lock works perfectly fine.camera is also good in this cost(do not expect stability).there is no lag while using.The best part is battery, if you are not a heavy end user then you even need not see the battery for even 2 days, once it is fully charged.the worst part is display, very poor visibility in daylight.
"
658,"  The phone built quality seems good. The weight is a little more than expected. Battery life and camara is good. Latest version of Android is also provided. Better finger print reader was expected. Bigger size scanner on back would be better.
"
659,"  New fingerprint reader is awesome with nice ergonomics. Battery life no complains because of bed processor technology. Camera quality is ok ok at this price.
"
660,"  Totally unsatisfied with the PLS TFT display and heavyweight.PLS TFT screen is low quality couldn't enjoy video steaming. If you are in habit of watching a movie and playing gaming then you can search for other better mobile,Now both Amazon and Samsung refused to accept return or provide me replacement of better quality display (i.e, Amoled, IPS Display).
"
661,"  Obviously battery is 6000 maH the phone is very heavy and feels like a brick in hand.The battery life is not that great but satisfied as a non gaming phone.Don't buy this if you are looking for a phone with good performance during playing games. This phone is good only for daily use and you can gift your parents or elders who are not into gaming or desire high performance.
"
662,"  Worst samsung phne ever. Its heavy. display is so not smooth have to like press each button atleast thrice. Cant ans calls on time as it kips hangin. Its not even a month since i purchased.  Camera is average.
"
663,"  After using the phone for 45 days ,it looks good to use with low refresh rate and good battery backup, decent camera . Phone little bit heavy due to heavy battery and Wifi 5g band wont support in this phone.Also can use dual 4g sim at a time.
"
664,"  Don't buy this phone, it has some technical issues
"
665,"  The phone is best buy, in terms of pricing and features. I guess this is the best option if someone is looking for a good Samsung phone at a proper budget
"
666,"  First of all, this mobile will not work like 4 GB ram mobile. it has touch issue and it hangs very much . even if you do not have any thing in your mobile still it hangs while using youtube.do not purchase blindly by seeing attractive price then you suffer a lot. there is no return policy.
"
667,"  Very nice phone .but it very much heavy than compare to other phones.you can't carry in your pocket while woking. If you are field worker I suggest don't buy .
"
668,"  This is worst product from Samsung.  Under 10k we can move to vivo, oppo, or redmi brands wisely.  Camera quality is very very poor.  After taking photo we see broken pixels and the worst picture.  48MP true camera is only for mouth speech really it is very worst one.  Mobile become heat while charging alone.  Very much disappointed.  Not worthy for money.  Don't buy this product.
"
669,"  Pathetic phone .Battery good.Camera poor.Performance very poor, very slow.When you cut a call than notification of call ended arrivez and stays there for 5 minutes. You can not see complete keyboard while using other app. Absolutely pathetic.Charger very very poor.Screen poor.Sound poor.Overall below average phone in 10k price.
"
670,"  Bakwas camera .. picture  quality  bohoth hi kharab hai.. 48mp camera  lagta hi nahi hai.. aur front camera  toh wahiyaad hai.. 2mp camera  jaisa pics ata hai... but battery  back up achha hai.. looks  bhi thikh thakh hai... yeh phone  uncle  aunty ke liya bana hai.. young  kisi ko pasad nahi ane wala hai..
"
671,"  I really liked the mobile, look and feel is goodBattery as committed last long, camera clarity is okay, one of the best I used as per Samsung. Charger says it's fast charging it's fake, it takes more than 2 hrs to get 100% charged. Fingerprint is not good, I struggle everytime.
"
672,"  Waste product. Both amazon and Samsung cheated us. Worst camera. Mobile is too heating while charging. If long time on a call when also mobile get more heating. Finally the most worst experience is Amazon did not retake the mobile when we give request for return. The return policy is very worst. So please no one but this waste mobile

676,"  Dislike....not supporting other applications like WhatsApp,  Facebook,  trucaller,  Microsoft teams...going to automatically switch off & vanishing above applications.  Want to try replace or return. But there is no option. I will not purchase any electronics products through online.
"
677,"  Very slow phone, don't buy it,,,i've been using it since 3 months,,but my experience with this phone is very bed,,,it is useless. Makes me irritate while using it due to slow response,,,, please think thrice before buy it,,,i have used phone with same configuration, but really it is comparatively too too too much slow.
"
678,"  Have given 5 star if I would have got fully satisfied with Display.. I purchased this for my mother in law and found is good..camera : Good -As expected..Design : Good enoughDisplay : Is not Amoled. so you will not get that feel which We get with other Samsung product. But overall nice..

"
682,"  Battery: The battery backup is not longing even for half daySoftware: the app icoi is disappearing very oftenCamera: looks like 5 mp camera
"
683,"  The phone was fantastic .......On a scale of 1 to 10 I will give it 9 ......The thing that I didn't like about this is that it has very less storage ........Otherwise very good  MUST BUY
"
684,"  I am using this phone from two days. I have exchanged my redmi 4 with m12. But after two days of usage, I found that this phone is not fast as redmi 4.
"
685,"  I read reviews and got into dilemma when got mixed reviews.But according to me, its worth a buy.All functions i found good with a good screen size.The only con felt was that it was a little heavy for the pocket.
"
686,"  Thats some competition in the budget phone market, the device looks sturdy,,, overall good, good display and battery.... Looks like i don't need a new phone for 3-4 year anymore....
"
687,"  Charging point in mobile is not working and as this one is my second mobile I started it bit late and return period is over, this one is made in  India Samsung Mobile.
"
688,"  Battery charging is fast and consumes less power. The only drawback is mirroring/casting of videos is not satisfactory  as videos on TV appeared  staggering.
"
689,"  Impressed by Delivery, delivered within 4 days. Delivery boy was humble. I ordered this phone for my Friend who was using Redmi 4A since 2017, I was worried for it's TFT LCD panel as it is not as good as IPS LCD, but amazed with its screen quality. Screen quality is justified for its price (I got it in 8.5k in Festive offer) and brand value and Viewing angles are acceptable.
"
690,"  Overall ok experience, no cons. Getting a mobile with such configuration that too from a brand like Samsung, you can’t expect more. If your budget is fix and looking for made in India phone, go for it.
"
691,"  Terrible Quality - Substandard Product - 3rd world Quality.. Cheating the INDIAN Customer..Want to RETURN My Product which I hardy used for 8days... Missed the Amazon Return policy due to Diwali Holiday Gift.DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG Phones - #BOYCOTTSAMSUNGMOBILE

692,"  Awesome phone..Value for money..I gifted this phone to my wife and I can see the happiness on her face..Very good camera both front and rear.. with good memory..
"
693,"  Samsung never dissapointed me. The mobile at the price of 10999/- is a steal deal. The 6000mAh battery is a power house with excellent backup. The 48 MP camera is capturing good pictures. Display is quite good. I am totally satisfied with the phone.
"
694,"  There's a dent on my brand new Samsung Galaxy M12 I called customer care for the first time and they told me we would change your phone and Then second time they told me we would return your money Phone and box look like it’s used and old
"
695,"  Phone display looks very dull, no setting to take pics in 48 mp. Photos came with low resolution when shot with camera. Not worthy to buy this model at this price. Camera is not at all 48mp.
"
696,"  It is a worthy mobile.Con's.Samsung provided normal travel adapter for charging. Which it take almost 2-3 hours to get full.Front camera is not that much good. I disappointed with this.Trasperant case is not provided. For other mobile every one will provide. Samsung is not providing this.
"
697,"  I have 2 Airtel connected phone one in samsung M12 and another in realme. I need to keep samsung phone in balcony to catch network but realme works fine in every corner of house. GPS is pathetic, it keeps saying GPS signal lost when you drive on a new route using GPS

698,"  Like : Look is nice, camera is good, user friendlyDislike : Wifi 5g not available, performance is not really good for 6gb ram, quite heavy to carry.Good for the cost but disappointed on the network.
"
699,"  On seeing it's features I bought this in exchange offer. It is not upto the mark. Processor is very slow. Weight is also high 221gm. Performing slow.

"
705,"  Camera is not upto the mark. 48MP camera feels like 5MP. Processer is bit slow while using many applications. Samsung still lags in budget segment smartphones.
"
706,"  This phone has amazing specs, awesome battery life, mind blowing ram and processor, but I feel disappointed with the sensors. The phone lacks gyro sensor. You can't even play games on this phone. Forget games, the simple compass app will not work as the phone cannot sense rotation vectors. Therefore it's a toothless tiger.

"
712,"  I bought it because I didn't want to buy a Chinese phone for obvious reasons.It works smooth enough.But buy a protective screen guard which has oleophobic coating as the original display sucks.Overall it is a nice phone which I bought for my mother.Easy to customize things like fix the alignment of icons on home screen and hide unwanted apps.
"
713,"  I gifted this phone to my mom, unfortunately she couldn't do complete check of the phone within the days for return policies, we realised it a week later than this phones speaker has major problem. While on speaker and in horizon mode opposite person wil not be able to hear. Tried to get the replacement but no luck by Amazon team. A bit disappointed
"
714,"  This device is awesome if u get it under 10,000.I got it @9,998.There is a miner lag in UI and it gets heat up (not quickly)if u use it for gaming.Camera is outstandingDisplay is goodSound is goodLooks is goodProcesser is avg(as we know😑)And last not the least - Battery is like a big MONSTER.Lasts upto 2.5 days .
"
715,"  Display is worse. Very much unlike Samsung. I thought the first product had some display issues so I returned and got another one. But display itself is made like that
"
716,"  Pathetic experience  with Samsung.Really samsung is zero in Android...I will not recommend any one to buy the Samsung brand phones ....It's a wastage of money 💰....I have brought 3 phones of Samsung brand,and in all phones there is hanging ,phone heating ,net slow 🐌 and bugs issue .  frequently

719,"  In budget segment it is amazing phone with good camera ,remarkable battery and OneUi has no comparison in software and by look it look smart only issue is it is slightly bulky and think but monster battery in mind it is good phone ,if anyone purchase this phone it will not drawback for him/her
"
720,"  This is the best smartphone in budget smartphones. The camera quality and clarity of samsung m12 is very good. Battery life 6000mh isvery powerfull it will stand for long life. Fingerprint reader is also good, it will give fingerprint reader at power button which gives it classy and unique look. Overall it is outstanding smartphone in low budget.

"
722,"  Camera quality does not meet the standard as described in features. Being 48 mega pixel camera does not click good quality pictures also the colours of camera clicked pics are very dull. Front camera is of worst quality.
"
723,"  I have samsung a50, comparing the camera quality this M12 is dull and poor inspite this being quad camera setup. Only this battery life is good. And provided the budget can't complain much. But still there are many good camera quality smart phones available in this range. Advice you all to check in person and then order the device
"
724,"  Main cause is lcd screen in this costOther brand give very much better options. I had very bad experience with Samsung M12. Why Samsung has made this with lcd
"
725,"  Very dissapointed product.Not value for Money.If it is for rs.8000 it is OK.Only positive feedback is Battery backup.Camera- Not good front and rear.Finger print- Not comfirtable.NO default call recording option.If you having tru call then we can recordLittle more weght compared to other smart phone. And having hang for some times.

730,"  This phone is a budget  phone  which  will help with long 1 and half day  battery life with always full brightness, location and data on .  Camera is  good  on pro mode  but cannot  be compared  with  high  pixel phones.  6 GB ram is enough  for play  games. This phone has enough  fps for games like  pubg, asphalt  games  no lag.
"
731,"  This phone is not original, camera quality is very poor its written 48Mp but even the picture quality is less than 10MP, always heating and very slow, Then we registered the complaint, service appointment was yesterdy no one came for service and also we received Mail service is done, Very very bad service and we dont know where should contact.
"
732,"  Camera quality is blur and sometimes this phone hang without any reason I don't know why this phone hang when RAM is 6 gb and 8 nano meter processor.Display quality is also not up to mark as we see in samsung phones what you are giving in this phone samsung if don't have buget for this type  phone they why you promoting mid buget phones.
"
733,"  Weight is heavy other than that it is worth the money , but since battery is big and works very long it is heavy . Little slow at opening the apps, sometimes apps lag, but i hope it will work for long time . You dont need to worry about charging the phone often, once fully charged even if used continuously it stands for one day.
"
734,"  The stuff is too good and it's working so well. It's fingerprint senser is so good specially the camera bit there is one problem I dislike about it that it's battery backup is so poor and the battery Neel down so fast and also one thing there is limited fonts in this device for using it freely....but all over this device so good and I appreciate this product

Performance is smooth. a phone worth of money.

757,"  Phone is hanging and touch screen not working even after many taps goes on change other button not that which I have tapped want to return
"
758,"  6GB ram with 128GB memory makes this phone best in class at these rates. Battery of 6000mah also gives it the most numbers with the brand name of Samsung. This is really unbeatable phone in its class.

773,"  I bought this phone 2 weeks ago and found this to be very heavy in terms of its weight.Additionally, the camera quality is not so good. The battery also lasts for a day with almost 1 hour of talk time.According to me, it's not a good value for money.I was expecting a better camera quality and battery backup.
"
774,"  The phone hangs sometimes while switching between apps. Otherwise it is good. Good for light usage. Battery is phenomenal! It has no heating issues.Camera is not as good as aspected, but works fairly well.Screen resolution  is not as good as expected.Screenshot gesture on phone is not available.Overall it is okayish.

"
781,"  Amazing phone. Budget phone. Features awesome. Using 2 month. Its wonderful. Camera quality is awesome. Special wide angle 122° camera. Battery performance too good. Dolby Atmos sound feature is tha main point. Feel like theatre. Speacially Samsung Galaxy Ear Buds Pro comparable. i have earbuds.Guys please go on this phone. Amaizing phone.
"
782,"  This phone is reasonably good for the reason that price tag and features are incomparable at all. Excellent finger print reader that pushes the gadget to the nexgen range. As a lay user I can say that the camera is not that impressive as the one expects in 48MP camera. The processor is also just fine if not awesome.
"
783,"  Am writing this review after 2 yrs of usage  .Daily usage : 2 hrs ( soft handling )I updated to latest andriod update . After that mobile not getting swicthed on . Only samsung logo is appearing .V worst experience . Checked with help center .they told will charge 6k but no warranty .Thrown away to e waste !!
"
784,"  Overall great phone battery drain problem issue found speaker output quality not good I replace it on the first time but I didn't meet the quality of sound in the bass and picture quality not too good I suggest those who want purchase this phone kindly think many times before purchasing this phone. Picture quality is not HD only written is HD+ poor quality.

"
786,"  Excellent phone with reasonable price tag and with the assured service of Samsung. Camera quality is quite good compared to redmi (Chinese) products. Battery Life is awesome with fastest 80nm processor. Display is good but i was expecting fhd+ display but current quality is also good with 90hz display overall it is midrange phone and i satisfied with the phone
"
787,"  Faulty product delivered to me worst experience mobile battery is no charging and having problem with connector. Picture quality also blurred in between watching videos. I have m31 mobile as well and try same charger too facing same issue. Product purchased just 3 months back. I need immediate refund or replacement of this product.
"
788,"  Excellent phone in this range, with good battery, only thing of concern is its finger print reader location, many times login error appears due to different finger or hand location getting accidently touched to finger print reader, which is a bit annoying.
"
789,"  Don't buy this product bad  camera quality only battery back good .I have use this product and i am sharing the feedback . So please don't buy go to some where else  likeVivo and Redmi.
"
790,"  It's a really very nice phone and good working also camera quality Good and battery backup too good 👍I liked product.
"
791,"  Dislike: This phone could not able to find network  all time it goes to offline with the good network when we compare with other phones.I recommend to my friend also so it has the same problem.This phone is launched by Amazon only for their customers.From this we conclude whatever the company failure products are available in Amazon selling.
"
792,"  Hai mobile is very bad every time heating at the time charging the time heating problem the mobile is worst mobile and Amazon customer very very very very worst customer and told there is no responsibilities in Amazon customer so many time I was calling Amazon customer but there is no response at Amazon customer
"
793,"  A little bulky... in size and weight..Battery life is amazing.. i charge once in 2 days inspite of being on calls most of the day.Finger print is very quick n sensitive. But wrongly placed. Mostly it gets touched while taking out of the pocket n it says 5 incorrect finger prints and locks the mobile.
"
794,"  Phone look like a ugly
"
795,"  It's shown 4 rear camera  and upto 48mp but worst that 5mp . Even a Chinese mobiles under 3000 value gives better  photos than this phone. Really  disappointed.
"
796,"  Samsung is good brand.  I like this phone so very much, it has perfect camera quality, no hang issue, good sound quality and perfect in size and shape.  Fully satisfied according to price. Thanx Samsung for giving such a wonderful phone in reasonable cost.
"
797,"  never buy this Samsung below 17k mobiles all the worst mobiles they wont function at all in all angles and more over battery 🔋 the worst experience
"
798,"  Actually I bought this mobile for my mom, and she said that she is having a wonderful experience in using the mobile.To keep it simple, go for it
"
799,"  Bought it for my mom as her note 5 pro was broken. This one is really good and she's absolutely happy with the phone.
"
800,"  this is the best phone I have ever used don't listen to rumors about M12 everything display quality,  touch response, quick biometric, best camera true 48 mp, charged in just 2.5 hrs completely, decent sound quality go for it.
"
801,"  Battery is goodCamera is not good. Zoom the images or a pic taken using zoom and all details are lost. Hoping Samsung release some update to improve it. It has pre-installed and unwanted apps so usable memory is less than expected. May be Samsung can keep these on cloud rather than phone and leave a choice to the user.
"
802,"  Phone performance is good for daily uses. Battery performance is good enough for a day.i like fingerprint sensor is fast n simple to use. I'm disappointed with the given camera quality. Phone heating issues comes when used continuously with normal function and playing games.fast is not that fast. But I like this Phone at this price range.
"
803,"  The screen is too fragile. My 5 year old accidentally dropped it twice. Both times the display shattered. This occurred within 2 months of use.
"
804,"  The phone's heavy to hold due to the big 6000 mAh battery, but still the battery life is not upto the mark. That's disappointing. The fingerprint reader is fast and good. The camera quality is average. Overall the phone is average for the cost. And samsung is still the same, 100GB RAM is also too low for their mobile phone.
"
805,"  It's a beast at 9999 with ICCCI bank discount. 6000 mah battery with 24h+ backup. Ways camera which clicks beautiful pictures. TFT screen - can't expect more with this price. Performance is good. And the best is the finger print sensor, it's ultra first and the fingerprint on the power button makes the phone more beautiful.
"
806,"  Fisplay glass is tremendously delicate .. even if mobile falls from 1-2 inch, we see lots of scratches. Once mobile falls down from pocket and camera shattered. Not at all worthy product. Picture quality not good. Camera is volor blind, can't detect Green color .. green is taken in blue shades .. strongly not recommended 😑
"
807,"  It's  a gud handset, when I purchased this in April as technology and features get up graded every month. This runs andriod 11 now we have version 12 in July.
"
808,"  This phone having lots of bugs, i bought it for my papa and he is saying it's too slow to respond the keypad and software is crashing overall disappointment
"
809,"  This product is worth in its price value.A must buy phone for day to day working,battery is amazing, display is great as per price.Overall a good non Chinese phone.
"
810,"  This phone is good in that range of price. Only disadvantage I could see is, it's very heavy to carry. It would have been very nice of weight of phone is reduced
"
811,"  AS 6000Mah battery is not running good. According to 6000Mah. And front camera is very bad. Front camera quality is very bad. Please don't buy this product. And packing is  Very bad at the time of shipping. Don't buy this product. 40% information are fake at the time of product buying. According to features of this phone. Don't buy this.
"
812,"  Don't believe paid negative review because this phone is a Masterpiece I am very honest you can buy this phone this is best budget phone2 days battery life in single charge camera qualitie is blockbusterQuickest fingerprint sensorBlockbuster phone 👍👍👍👍👍👍
"
813,"  Cons:Phone was not connecting to 4g networkMain camera(48MP) quality at par to 5 MP cameraMacro shot gives blurry imagePhone heats up a little bit( manageable )Pros:Will update once i get the replacement phone
"
814,"  Overall phone is good but camera quality was really bad I was not expected such a bad quality from samsung. If anyone buying this mobile to click good photography then it's highly not recommended.
"
815,"  Bought this for my mom. The product is great with all features working perfectly. Go for it - it's a great phone in the budget.
"
816,"  I have purchased this product almost a month ago, the product was defective since the voice of both side person was not audible. Hence I raised the request to return or replacement but till now nobody is arrived to my place. If you are not taking action on this, I need see for the further action to be taken
"
817,"  Have used the phone for a month. Works very well so far, no obvious issues. Haven't tried some features (e.g. fingerprint reader, dual Sim). It's great that it utilizes Android 11  (the most recent version), although too many apps are preloaded. Camera/video recorder works well. Good product in this category. Exceeded my expectations.
"
818,"  The Samsung Galaxy M12 is a Battery monster(as advertised) it will last a lot longer than the typical smartphone and it's worth the money spent on it, my only problem is the 720p display, samsung could have gone with a 1080p oled but the display here is not horrible, the image quality is quite good actually, and One UI 3.1 is awesome.
"
819,"  The newly lahnched phone is packed with everything that can come blow 13k inr. The camera The battery and The design of The phone is perfect in every manner. I recommend this product if someone wants a good smartphone under 15k.
"
820,"  safety delivery.....exchange offer very good.......time of exchange within minute....phone price also very reasonable.........
"
821,"  Not worth at all! Neither processor nor camera is good. Camera is so poor at this price range, better to look other option than this. Also the phone is super heavy.
"
822,"  Low in signal whether it is network signal or wifi networkLagging alot because of samsung processor.Very disappointed.
"
823,"  Best phone at this price range. Amazing battery life, only con is- selfie camera is not up to the  mark (according to MP level)
"
824,"  Good mobile i buy this for my grandmaa she is happy 😊 battery backup is great and screen quality is quite impressive fingerprint is fast but camera is not like Samsung even j7 have good quality camera if we compare from this. 48 mp is blunder  quality is like 5 - 8 mp
"
825,"  Lovely product. Great finishing. Loved camera quality.  Good mid range mobile at steal away price. Didn't find finger print reader comfortable. May be I am used to back side finger print reader. 5000 mah better runs good. Would have loved if it was 6000. mah
"
826,"  Newest and cool system for fingerprint, monster battery , charge is staying for 2 days al least.sleek design..fast processor.. camera good.
"
827,"  Audio quality not good, can't hear voice loud and clear on call, If planning to buy this for parents don't buy, instead go for m21 if need a samsung phone only. Please don't buy it.
"
828,"  It's been hardly a month since I bought this phone and it has hung already. The camera quality is not cool, the refresh rate is not at all good and most importantly, the battery capacity is not as good as promised. This phone is just another scam, don't buy this. Don't be fooled.
"
829,"  Small budget but great quality in processor and batter life. Camera quality is not great but for the given budget it is ok. Heavier than m31. Bigger than m31 and better battery life than m31. Processor speed wise i feel same as m31. So if you are not much focused on camera, then this is best budget phone
"
830,"  My main purpose was using phone for calls and what app. But after getting this product I started using games, started taking selfies and main thing started watching movies with HD quality... watching 2 movies per day with HD and still having battery life of 75%. It's awesome. Fingerprint was quite good accommodated in power button.
"
831,"  Selfie camera is not good.. But product design and performance not bad. under this price section is good. Sound quality is quite good. Not recommend for heavy gamer. There is no FHD.
"
832,"  Got it for 9.5k and good phone, hangs a bit but ok for daily use
"
833,"  Sad and Pathetic display, also feels like camelin geometry box in your hand, everything is slow abt this phone, u can have a tough tine woth the pjoje display  i wonder if these celebrities are using this phone :p
"
834,"  Poor display, color contrast in this cellphone was very low . I don't know it is particular my handset issue or something else. I had some urgency that's why I was unable to replace that cellphone. But my advice is don't buy this one. Their offers are just a scam to sell their poor products.
"
835,"  Never buy this mobile to take indoor photos as it has a very poor quality camera. You can't find yourself in photos if you took photo at night. It would be a total waste of money if it doesn't have long battery life. yeh mobile lene ke baad mein chootiyan ban gaya....amazon customer wale ne muhje phir bhi chootiyan bana rahe hei...
"
836,"  Nice phone. I have been using this phone for last 1months. According to me The best part of this mobile is the battery 🔋 Thank you .
"
837,"  Very heavy weight. Average camera, very short usb cable. Also, did not get headphones with the package. Not that good for this price.
"
838,"  I haven't expected a better phone in this price range. Along with the brand name of Samsung you are getting great camera, great screen, great battery backup, and 2ghz quad core processor.It's a great but until now.
"
839,"  This phone is not up to mark like other Samsung mobile. It doesn't have dual band WiFi connection. It doesn't have 5Ghz WiFi receiver. It only has 2Ghz WiFi receiver. So you will get lesser speed when connected to 2ghz
"
840,"  इस फोन में बहुत सारे प्रॉब्लम है चार्ज में लगाने के बाद फोन ऑटो ऑफ हो जाता है फिर उसे ऑन करने में घंटों लग जाते हैं मैं किसी को राय नहीं दूंगा कि इस फोन को परचेज करें और आप कभी भी आर्डर करें आपको सेकंड हैंड मोबाइल ही दिया जाएगा डिस्प्ले में डॉट रहता है बाकी बहुत सारे मल्टीपल प्रॉब्लम है फाइनली यह फोन नहीं लेना चाहिए
"
841,"  Finger print reader on right side integrated with power button. Difficult to use the left hand fingers for reading the prints....
"
842,"  I bought this phone for my mother and am happy with the purchase. It is pretty easy to use for anybody in one's household. The storage space,  and overall speed and performance of the phone is also great!
"
843,"  Everything with the phone is super nice apart from a couple of things: finger reader lags for 2-3 sec before response & Google Maps keep on flickering while on navigation mode
"
844,"  Received in damaged condition while calling display gone blank and I need to restart after every call to get display again.
"
845,"  After using a few days...1. For normal user the phone is really Amazing2. Great battery backup with C-type charger3. Nice camera and very natural quality4. Safe and secure OS by Samsung5. Nice display qualityThanks amazon for your great service 👍
"
846,"  I had purchased this product on thebprime day announced by Amazon. As a prime customer, I thought there will be a discount but actually there was ""0"" discount on this mobile. It is available on the same price and with zero cost EMI on credit card.It's just a marketing gimmick.
"
847,"  The phone works fine and all but it is not pleasing to the eye. The colours of the screen are extremely desaturated and everything ends up looking dull or like there's a Matte film on the screen. Very disappointing. Also Amazon will not let me return this product so now I am stuck with it. Disappointed in Amazon service as well.
"
848,"  Recently bought samsung m12 6gb mobile. Within one week i am facing issue with phone mic. It is not working. When I started searching for the solution I came to know that the issue is with all the samsung latest releases. Really disgusting and now have to search for samsung service centre. Buy one and get your headache for free.
"
849,"  ना तो dual app work करता है, second whatsapp data not showing second data, media file is मिसिंग, और तो और फोल्डर मे से फोटो अपने आप delete होते हे, samsung कंपनी solution not provide after 6 month, इसे तो चायनीज कंपनीया जलदी solution provide करती हे, please dont buy any samsung m series phone, total waste of money

"
852,"   6000 mah battery stands for two days.Camera quality is not much better with competitors.
"
853,"  Performance is not good. But as a better battery backup it can be purchased. Not an option for heavy usage as the performance will tire us and it will not be fast enough.
"
854,"  Overall  Phone is superb in this price range. Samsung need to make sure availability of suitable Covers so that it's finger print reader is easily accessible.
"
855,"  This phone is very good at this rate.  All its features are very good. Internal memory, RAM, Camera quality etc. Go for it.
"
856,"  Finger - print reader is good but could have a little bit more sensitivity.Camera - It's really goodBattery life - most attractive of all features. With normal use, it can stretch from 1 to 1.5 day backup.
"
857,"  The camera quality and the battery health attracts the phone. The price range is really beneficial. People who need to click photos and watch Netflix and are internet savvy should have this. Price worthy overall. The processor is pretty good and fingerprint sensor could have been on the screen but presently it is not that bad.
"
858,"  I expect fingers print reader should be on screen or back of the phone but it's at the edge on power button which is uncomfortableRest is fine and better at this price
"
859,"  Good battery life , fast charging is also good,Camera quality is better , phone doesn't heat up while use for a long period, easy installation and procuring of your older data .If you are looking for a Good smartphone near about 10000 you must buy this item M12 .
"
860,"  Do not buy.Waste of moneyFront camera have a huge issue. It's manufacturing defectsI want to give 0 star, but option not available
"
861,"  Worst mobile phone, I used it only 2 months it's otg and fast changing system is being worsted, also network connectivity and internet connectivity very poor. Battery charging is very slow. Network automatically disconnected after using 20 to 30 minutes.and it's connected again when you restart the phone 2-3 time continually.
"
862,"  Pros:  -Good battery life  -Decent camera qualityCons:  -Display isn't great,  -Processor is from old age.  -graphic quality is little rusty, visual quality is not sharp or vividVerdict:Their are many best alternatives Phones available for the price. Don't go for M12/A12/F12
"
863,"  Its 90hz screen rates makes it seems best. Not for heavy gaming but still you can play games under 1GB in a quite good way. Impressed with battery life. The things I don’t like is the speaker. Speaker are a bit low. Rest is great. I got this for 9499 ₹
"
864,"  Sometimes laggs, face unlock is very slow, camera quality is not as mentioned.Fingerlock is good, battery is good.Automatic brightness function is not good.Paisa kam ho to hi lena.

"
868,"  Performance is quite good. If you want a phone for gaming its suitable for it but can't play games which are more than 800 minutes like free fire or pubg you can play free fire in the settings smooth. If you want this phone for regular purposes then its a good phone it has smart view and quite good features. Value for money.
"
869,"  Very bad camera especially when did a 10X Zoom the picture is highly pixelated .. instead of this pls prefer redmi note 9https://amzn.to/3fe0y2F
"
870,"  It is a decent phone. Camera is good. Battery is excellent. For day to day use you can buy it. If you are a heavy user or if you are looking for a phone for heavy gaming then its not for you. Overall good. 4 star. Thats all
"
871,"  I am very disappointed with the purchase I get annoying ads very often I don't know how to remove then even I tried every method to remove them please help me to get rid of this  I don't know I have bought this in sale that's why this problem is happening if you cannot solve it I recommend every one to not. Buy this phone .
"
872,"  The phone is very nice at a price point of 13,500 provided type C although fast charging is not supported it's still good . While rear camera is Very Good and the camera app s UI is very good with many features and modes  but the Front Camera is ok not that amazing . And at last a huge storage of 128gb make it a good deal .

"
884,"  I recommend not to buy.Samsung downgraded all the Processor, Display, Camera.Its doesn't seems like a Samsung phone.Other phones like Xioami, Redmi, Vivo, Oppo are better than this at this price.

"
891,"  I bought this assuming a Samsung mobile, but its just a ripoff of some cheap mobiles available. Extremely heavy and sometimes even gets hot. Even the glass is not smooth as it used to be Great features but then those are available in cheap variants as well. Changed my rating after using it for a few months
"
892,"  Not so good, just average.Even it's getting hot while calling someone, i don't know samsung m 12 follows or not SAR regulations.But i just want a non Chinese phone so i bought this, but there more options available here in samsung and others.And also a better option is Micromax (part -2).

1048,"  I have bought M12 mobile on Apr2021 and the cost of Rs.90000/-. It was working good and when you playing the games got struck up. So I'm strongly not recommended for game players.
"
1049,"  Good performance from last 10days(the day I bought it) classy look and better performance with multitasking and multiple profiles. As I have official and personal Apps profile configured on to it. Works amazingly on both
"
1050,"  Too heavy for a person to hold it in a pocket and it’s thickness is also more. Over all a bulky good phone at its 10-11k price.
"
1051,"  after using for month feel it is value for money.  battery stays charged for days.  better would be more powerful charge it takes bit of time to charge battery.
"
1052,"  Around 10,000 ho for it until better arrives. Not for gaming. For normal people the phone is best
"
1053,"  I like  all , only  display  build  quality  is  low  no  gorrila  glass..protection. I  drop  only  one time  and  it  will  crack  accidently .
"
1054,"  Over all the Phone is fine. The worst part is the Camera, 48 MP is a joke, the photos are pixelated. Shoot in broad daylight its looks fine but zoom in and its pretty bad. Samsung I hope will come up with an update to make the camera really worth it.
"
1055,"  Phone is heavy. Camera quality is not upto the mark when compared with redmi note 9 and other phones in same category.Display is just average.Speed is good. Remaining all the features are good
"
1056,"  Charger not working within a month of purchase.The mobile is very good for its price.The fingerprint & face recognition is not upto mark.Camera & battery are good
"
1057,"  Fingerprint  sensor is very bad, camera quality is worst, battery life is not performing like a 6000 mah. Phone started hanging from the day 2nd. Build is good. Any phone of Xiaomi, even lower than this price will be performing much more better than this phone.
"
1058,"  Delay in Screen response.No compass app runs as basic requirement of compass app doesn't meet.Front camera resolution is low.Phone gangs some time.Won't recommend at this price.
"
1059,"  Although it says 48 MP camera, it just clicks  like a VGA shots or 5MP shots in a broad daylight. Don't know why with triple camera lense they give such poor quality. Battery life is good
"
1060,"  The display of the mobile is so poor that even a 7000/8000 range cheap mobile has much better display than this mobile. The charging rate is so slow that it takes around 3 hours to charge the battery fully. It ruined the joy of buying a new mobile , extremely disappointed.
"
1061,"  The Sumsung Mobile which I purchased from Amazon, is very poor quality & getting hung & facing  so many times.Today I can't call also.Before that I want to return or replace this one. But nobody attends me.I am a prime member & purchase so many goods. So you people solve this problem.
"
1062,"  Battery is good lasts for 1day after continue net brwosingFingerprint is good as expectedCamera quality quite best
"
1063,"  Camera quality I am wondering why there are claiming 48MP. Previously I used Samsung j7 max 16mp that can take better pictures.Battery Good.Processor Good for normal usage.Fingerprint sensor so Good.Overall good budget phone for normal usage.
"
1064,"  A great Deal for its price. Doesn't feel any lag, screen feels fluid.Only Con is its camera which is still great for its price but not on par with mid-rangers.
"
1065,"  With new replacement phone is very good and fast. Multi tasksing also more good. Battery life is awesome. On the whole best phone at this budget
"
1066,"  The product started lagging since day 1.Asked Amazon for replacement and they assures to send a engineer for inspection. The person never came and my inspection was marked resolved. It was a huge shame as I had gifted this to my Mom
"
1067,"  Battery life is very good. But it's fast charger is slower than Redmi Note 5 pro normal charger.Camera quality is also good in this price range. I have purchased this mobile for my child's online classes. My child is fully satisfied with its performance.
"
1068,"  Phone is good with good batter back up, good finger Print sense, good speed for gaming as well as for other activities.Only drawback is poor display and , poor picture / photos quality. I'll not recommend this for Photo Lovers as quality of picture / photos are bad.
"
1069,"  I am little bit worried about this product, it is 6000mAH battery but the charge exhausted within 24 hours. Second, charger is 15w fast charger but it takes almost 2hours 20 minutes for full charging. Third, Camera quality is not like 48mp. I am not fully satisfied with this product.
"
1070,"  This is a good budget phone. 6GB Ram is a plus point here. Display is decent. 90 Hz makes a difference while scrolling and feels smooth. Loaded with good Samsung features. Rear Camera is decent in day lightings. Front camera is poor. Phone is heavy but its ok once get habitual to it.
"
1071,"  The item was superb and premium quality and the camera quality was best but I don't know why people are hating it . Thank you Amazon for giving us a great item🤗🤗😍

"
1091,"  Camera is okay. Fingerprint is okay.  Sometimes phone is hanging and still facing network issues. 95% downloading data is not working 100% working uploading data only. Battery is very very worst.  It's drained quickly. M12 is totally waste. Don't buy guys.
"
1092,"  Nice product. Worth money
"

"
1104,"  Battery life ek din bhi nahi hai, fas gaya ye phone le kar, 6000 mah battery sirf kahne ki hai, bina use k bhi bht tej drain hoti hai. Waste of money because of battery life. Face lock bhi kaam nahi kar raha, password daal kar hi open hota hai
"
1105,"  The Samsung Galaxy M12 is affordable, looks good, and has a large battery. for camera 2.5 STAR, battery 5 STAR, charger 5 STAR, OS SPEED 2.5 STAR, HEAVY WEIGHT PHONESASTA ACHA TIKAU
"
1106,"  It is value for money phone in turms of  entertainment and day to day use except side finger sence. Beacause when put it in/out  to your pocket unknowingly you touched the sensormany times.
"
1107,"  I liked the fingerprint censor,camera and screen. As screen is very long it helps you with online classes and learn better. It's eye comfort shield feature is really helpful when you want to use your phone for a long time.
"
1108,"  इस mobile का कैमरा बहुत ही बकवास हैं कम्पनी द्वारा बताये अनुसार इस फोन का कैमरा काम नहीं करता हैं इसमें first photo इस मोबाइल ki हैं व second photo मेरे realme 6pro ki cilck की हुईं photo हैं mujhe ye product बिलकुल भी पसन्द नहीं आया। मुख्यत कैमरा जो की बिलकुल ही Acha नहीं हैं।

"
1110,"  The phone is quite heavy if ur used to using a light one.... this is phone is atleast 3 times heavier than my previous phone. Camera quality is not bad, it is average. For this price I find that pros outweigh than cons outrageously.
"
1111,"  Good value for money but the battery efficiency is not upto the mark as what is claimed . It is still average with 6000mah battery . Battery drainsatleast  20% in 4 hours without any use. Rest all is good do far.
"
1112,"  Bought the 64gb ram and 128gb internal storage varient of the M12 phone and using it ever since.  Happy with the purchase.Pros: Samsung UI, battery life, display, camera, software updates,Cons: weight
"
1113,"  Camera is good. Battery capacity is very good. overall performance is good. Display resolution is also very good.
"
1114,"  The qualities which gives this device an edge then other smartphones with same price is it's – *Battery life* 6000 mAh ,that's huge also with quick recharge , quad camera with 48MP camera and 6GB RAM AND 128GB ROM which is way better than other smartphones with the same price.
"
1115,"  Speaker is not functioning properly.when call is put on speaker terrible humming sound ,no clarity in sound. Cannot play audio song because of humming sound.purchased / received this new mobile on 2nd Nov 2021.Request to replacement of mobile
"

"
1117,"  So far it's very good.  The performance, speed and lasting can be checked after one year.
"
1118,"  Camera is average, battery life very good, processor is little bit slow as other brands, display is good  but not too good.
"
1119,"  Disappointed as the camera quality was not at all like 48 mp. Plus, a lot of pre installed app which can't be uninstalled by user.
"
1120,"  Phone performance is overall good but camera is of no use. Don't buy it if you want to capture photo memories.
"
1121,"  Overall performance is good but camera quality is not up to the mark and can be enhanced little more. Sometimes WiFi calling makes it difficult to call and it shows out of coverage so it's advisable not to use WiFi calling. Overall performance is nice.
"
1122,"  I have been buying only Samsung phone and purchase of this particular model made me to look for alternative in future. The display looks very dull even after adjusting brightness. I mean the typical  Samsung clarity is somehow missing in this particular model.
"
1123,"  Good phone and camera. There is no finger print sensor, other than that it awesome phone
"
1124,"  Excellent Mobile
"
1125,"  Only for one UI and samsung brandUseless DisplayBasic performanceLow camera qualityGood battery lifeGood sound in earphones, Bluetooth devices
"
1126,"  Pros- Battery life, compact, processor speedCons- Network connectivity- frequent error shows 'Network not registered '. Camera quality is bad in night modeBluetooth connectivity taking time
"
1127,"  camera resolution is not good.It says 48 megapixel ,but dosen't behave like that.sharpness and clarity missing.Display is fineOverall ok for given price point.
"
1128,"  Camera is niceBattery quality is awesomeSystem UI is goodRAM is just nice.6 month after use : it hangs alot even if we have 4 5 extra app on phone.
"
1129,"  Charger is worst, company saying fast charger provided with mobile kit, but it is totally bluff. It is taking 2 nd half hours for full charge. So, company to provide fast charger or pay compensation immediately to avoid this grievances from customers.
"
1130,"                    The media could not be loaded.
"
1131,"                
"
1132,"   At this price, fingerprint reader, battery life and camera quality are very good. However as because it is a LCD based display , display quality is not that great. Again considering the cost it is good. 90hz refresh rate is not experienced.
"
1133,"  The battery life on this phone is very good and the fingerprint reader being on the lock button is handy too.The camera shutter speed along with the speed on focusing is not the fastest but can be overlooked if camera specs is not a focused topic while buying the phone.
"
1134,"  The product is third class, it doesn't capture photo after focusing, camera focus is wrost and images are also not good as I was expecting. I'm literally not at all happy with this Samsung mobile. It also doesn't have gyroscope sensor, you can't play PUBG in gyroscope mode.
"
1135,"  I like it's Battery performance and overall build up quality. Camera performance is also better. Frankly speaking, I could not find any reason in last one month to dislike it.Though, it's a heavier but it is well-known for 6K mAH battery.
"
1136,"  Didn't like the camera for the price paid, in this price or less than that we can buy redmi 7 or any others which gives more better camera quality, it has 3camera but useless of having 3 camera. Camera quality is like a local phone camera.
"
1137,"  Overall experience for using this phone is good as under this budget you received nice phone with massive battery backup though camera quality is not up to Mark which I believe but overall phone is good you can buy it.
"
1138,"  1. Good quality in this price.2. Everything is monster and it's great.3. It hangs many times, even when I don't have any data.4. It's really heavy to use.5. Face and fingerprint reader are slow.
"
1139,"  Very disappointed the voice calling features was terrible.....earpiece is very bad ...I was not able to hear the other person voice by putting phone in loudspeaker and when I exchange phone the problem was the other person on phone was not able to hear my voice
"
1140,"  -Front camera is poor.-Battery life is good for average usage.-Finger print - i wont say slow but not that fast (tht issues i guess is with all samsung devices)- the major issue is with network reception, you cant hear the other person on the call clearly
"
1141,"  Too much heat and mic having issues... our voice not clear to others... my suggestion go ro redmi 9 power. i purchased both. that is better than this. other this go for any one better
"
1142,"  I purchased it from 2 months ago from my savings for a good phone but it's to bad and worst Mobile I suggest no body to purchased it mobile phone display was automatically off it  and phones is on display quality is worst and know service center was refused to change my phone
"
1143,"  The audio speaker is not working since beginning. Didn't notice since was using headphones most of the times (Purchase Date: 2nd April).  It's impossible to take calls without headphone or loudspeaker as the audio output slot is not functional at all!! Samsung please help!!
"
1144,"  Camera is good.90 HZ refresh rate. Smooth performance.Screen quality is good.Battery backup is great.Overall Good Smart phone.
"
1145,"  The camera is not good! I have Redmi note 7 pro which is also 48mp but has a batter camera!The phone is very huge it is very heavy and fatIt should be slim!!I didn't liked it at all
"
1146,"  I am really impressed with the speaker sound quality and voice clarity during calls. The camera is also good although I have not had a chance to use it much as there is not lot of going out nowadays.
"
1147,"  Superb excellent deliveryNo damageAll over agin good and excellent100% originale product
"
1148,"  This phone is better than Chinese phone in the budget. No blotware,no hang, time to time updates, camera is up to average, battery life reliable, side finger sensor working good and all features are good. 👌🇮🇳 👍At the time no issues.
"
1149,"  This is probably the best budget phone, you won't get a phone with such good features for just 11k, I got it montha ago everything is working well, charged it only once. Good one from Samsung.Good work by Amazon too for quick delivery .
"
1150,"  The phone got switched off on the 3rd day of purchase, Amazon service had come for Mobile inspection but did not anything after that. The phone is not working and Amazon has not provided any response about that.  Kindly return or exchange the phone
"
1151,"  2nd day my handset dead it’s not working I don’t hav word to say I m been scared to buy Samsung’s  cellphone nowI m sorry to say Samsung
"
1152,"  Display quality is not good. Samsung s secure not working. Battery is good. Camera is good at this price. No gorilla glass protection. Always on display not available.
"
1153,"  Like. Awesome mobile with this cost.
"
1154,"  The phone started lagging just after 1 month. I don't have too much apps and I never installed high ram consuming games like PUBG, FreeFire etc. still the performance is very poor.I am unable to pick the calls, the screen freezes.Pathetic.........
"
1155,"  Nice phone to buy with loaded features. But Battery is 6000mah but seems it's gets exhaust in a day and phone width is bit wide. Other all features are good and work fast like finger and face unlock.
"
1156,"  Product is good for price range. Battery backup is good. Battery running up to 1.5 days with moderate use. But phone is having good amount of weight because of large Battery. Camera is satisfactory.  Display is good. Finger sensor good.
"
1157,"  Almost all features are good, but call volume is very low, this is really necessary, hope samsung will fix this in next upcoming versions.
"
1158,"  this one works well at this price point instead of its camera, camera is like we are using a 3-4k range cam, worst picture quality.. bhai thoda bahut toh awkat mein rakho isko..MI 1s aaya tha MI Ka 1st phone 6000 mein uska front cam bhi iske back cam se achcha tha
"
1159,"  Pros - big battery, big display,Cons- no net speed meter, no 3 finger screenshot, not clean uv many useless samsung app u dont uninstall it, if u using screen guard n back cover your phone is like power bank thickness, if u want camera then this phone is not for u
"
1160,"  Battery life is very good. At one charge it can run for 2 days. Fingerprint reader is good and fast which is built-in power button and this thing is really impressive and also camera quality is good with quad camera. So, at this price point of view the phone is awesome.
"
1161,"  The phone performance, battery life and camera quality is good. But this phone is little heavy to carry and big in size. So feel little hard to fit into pocket.
"
1162,"  Awesome productBest feature of this phone is it 90hzTill now no cons visible
"
1163,"  Love this phone. For the price this is the best.Gets the job done for a smartphone.And to top it off. Killer offers from amazon and excellent service by samsung.
"
1164,"  Good battery. Awesome display and camera. Decent performance. No pre installed Chinese apps and it's made in India.
"
1165,"  Battery life not good. Finger print reader not effective. Phone is slower than a 3 GB phone. Camera not tested as not needed by me. Worthless for money charged
"
1166,"  48 mp true cam is a scam, even my old nokia sybian phone can capture better photo than this. While zooming the photos, it is like a water paint and fully pixelated. So dnt buy if camera is your preference.
"
1167,"  Good product with good battery life..i bought this for my brother in nov21..camera is quite low quality but good enough as compare to its price ...overall its a good product bellow 7.5k and i am fully satisfied with product
"
1168,"  Helllo I purchased my new phone Samsung m 12 6 128 on amazon. but phone camera is very bad because picture is very breaked and and phone is right side is dumped so I give to replace order but yet to be not replaced my phone. So kindly replaced my phone on same Address.
"
1169,"  I purchased this for my mother. Previous phone was lg and need to charge for twice a day but after purchasing this feeling better because charging after 2days mostly. Need to see some more days at present no issues
"
1170,"  Hi Amazon,We bought this mobile, but seems to be issue with Mobile.it is Heating continuously..If possible, please change our Mobile.
"
1171,"  Worst Product... don't buy this... cheap quality camera... not expected from Samsung... feed cheated.... have been using Samsung phones for 7 years..  never buy Samsung phone ever..
"
1172,"  Hanging like every 5 minutes and when I get call sending a template like call you back or pre define messages phone restarting and over heating,now I realized to exchange but window not allowing me to exchange or return this item kindly guide me
"
1173,"  Its good at this price, its been a week since I have used it high end games work smoothly, the battery does not drain or heat up while playing such games, the only average quality this phone has is its camera quality. It should have been improved with the given price.
"
1174,"  I gifted the cellphone to my mother. She is a gaming freak and a gadet freak too. I guess it's a must buy.
"
1175,"  I have stated using it.  I can give an opinion only after using it for some time. Good Packing , timely delivery etc is well appreciated. thanks.  Sreenivasan

"
1177,"  Display, Battery, Size, look, processor all Good. Camera needs to be better.Only phone and charger you will get. No headphone.!!!!
"
1178,"                    The media could not be loaded.
"
1179,"                
"
1180,"   The phone hangs a lot everyday for atleast 2 times. Then it automatically switches off and restarts. Touch response is really bad on this one. Doesnt even give the feedback of having 6gb ram. Seems less than 2gb
"
1181,"  Please don't buy any Samsung, it is good upto one year only, then next month  you have to spend money at Samsung service center frequently.. for example yesterday my m31s display gone while watching movie, which is purchased on September 2020..
"
1182,"  Very heavy product. Plz check actual weight before buying. Samsung states it to be of 221 gram but it was 265 grams when we physically checked. We didn't evaluated phone for other features as weight of phone was itself biggest negative feature.
"
1183,"  Fingerprint reader is too good it working smoothly. Battery life is also good once in a day I charge my mobile at 80% it sufficient for whole day. Just I want some more features in camera for taking pictures by rare camera. Overall performance is too good for gaming.
"
1184,"  The Phone will hang too much. Don't waste your money in this. Choose another. Because once you buy, You cannot return the phone at any cost nor you will get refund. In this case you will stuck with the phone. They will send replacement but every model will work slow.
"
1185,"  Phone was very good, it's awesome and it's an nice phone for this price and phone features are very good
"
1186,"  I got it for my mother to attend zoom calls. It's been 3days, and she has not been able to attend the call with audio. All combinations,settings has been tried. Feel bad that I can't help sitting from far. Can the service center help in Kanpur.
"
1187,"  Great deal. This is the best in the category. Fingerprint, camera and battery is much better than any Chinese mobile.
"
1188,"  Best Product in this range and not for heavy  drivers  .Much  better  for daily use  and medium productivity purpose.Rear  Camera shoots  steady videos and detailed pictures.
"
1189,"  Prosear slow display good battery backup good price High hai 7000 tak hota to thik HOTA
"
1190,"  Mobile good great product by Samsung.And Amazon services very very amazing 👏👌Actually my product delivery day is Tuesday but product come Saturday its mind blowing services I am fully happy
"
1191,"  This phone  , seal broken  , 54% charged  , Lots of fingerprints already applied  , Lots more ,Looks like Amazon is turning into flipkart
"
1192,"  Camera(slow motion missing) nice, processor goodFor app lock you should download application,Not having enough inbuilt like Mi if you use Mi you will be little disappointed bz at ds price Mi give more system and user friendly phone

"
1196,"  M12 is the worst mobile of Samsung, and if you went for its service center with any minor scratches or problem, they will say - It can not be considered under warranty policy.In one word they are doing a cheap minded business. They do not provide any warranty.
"
1197,"  Product is overall good. I used 6 GB RAM based phone earlier with 7000 mah motoG 5G model and this device M12 Samsung is lot much better in battery management compared to i5 and
"
1198,"  Camera quality is below average.  Whatever you click image got distorted. Disappointed with camera.

"
